## OSI Layers
- Open system Connection (OSI) is a model for how various application will interact over a network.
- It divides the architecture in seven segments.
- The lower layer deals with chunks of binary data and routing these data.
- Higher levels are responsible for network requests, network representation and protocol's as seen from a user's point of view.
- Each layer interacts with the layer above and below it.

|Layer|Description|
|---|---|
|**Application**|To allow access to network layers. Example - FTP, HTTP, DNS, SNMP|
|**Presentation**|To translate, encrypt and compress data.|
|**Session**|Establish, manage and terminate session.|
|**Transport**|Reliable process to process message delivery and error recovery. Ex - TCP, UDP|
|**Network**|Move packets from source to destination. Ex -IP, ICMP, ARP|
|**Data Link**|Organize bits into frame to provide hop-to-hop delivery.|
|**Physical**|To transfer bits over an electrical medium.|
