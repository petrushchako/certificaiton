## File System
The file system is a logical arrangement to store and retrieve data

- The file system can be local data storage via a network protocol or virtual files
- Most of the file systems use hard disks which are made of small fixed size blocks. Each block has an identifier to describe the start and end of the block
- Depending upon the file system architecture, file fragmentation occurs when some files are in noncontiguous clusters or some file are deleted
- Each file has a metadata consisting of size, date and time of creation, file type, access permission, owner of a file, etc.
