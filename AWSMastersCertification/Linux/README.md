## Linux introduction

Linux is an **Open Source Operating System** modelled on Unix, and developed in C language

**Open Source**
1. A software becomes open source if its source code is freely available
2. The free software movement was started in 1983 and 1998. Some developers coined the term "Open-Source" to make it less ambiguous and everyone adapted to it
3. Open source projects are generally a collaborative effort by multiple sets of developers to enhance the product and allow others to get benefit of it
4. The owner may put restrictions on usage, modification and distribution by various licensing, but it should be available to study for everyone
