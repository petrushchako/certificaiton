## Introducing Monitoring and Logging on AWS

In this lesson, we will explore key concepts and practices related to monitoring and logging in AWS, focusing on metrics, logs, and configurations. We'll cover the importance of collecting metrics, the sources of logs, and the role of configuration management. We will also relate these practices to the AWS Well-Architected Framework and provide some tips for the exam.

### Key Resources in Monitoring and Logging
- **Metrics**: Used to track variables over time to understand resource utilization and performance.
- **Logs**: Records of actions that occur in services or on your AWS account, helping to derive metrics and enhance security.
- **Configurations**: Settings or guidelines applied across cloud resources to enforce best practices and maintain security.

### Collecting Metrics
- **Purpose**: To monitor workload health, optimize resource utilization, and inform design decisions.
- **Examples**:
  - Number of Lambda invocations or errors
  - CPU utilization on EC2 instances
  - RDS read latency
- **Benefits**:
  - **Visualization**: Create charts for human interpretation and decision-making.
  - **Alerts**: Receive notifications when specific events occur (e.g., CPU utilization > 80%).
  - **Automation**: Trigger automated actions based on metric thresholds.

### Sources of Logs
- **Types of Logs**:
  - VPC Flow Logs
  - EC2 Instance Logs
  - Account Activity Logs
  - Application Logs
- **Security Use**:
  - Track actions by both humans and automated processes.
  - Investigate security events by inspecting logs to identify who or what made critical changes.

### Configuration Management
- **Definition**: Resource settings or standards that can be standardized across an AWS environment.
- **Importance**:
  - **Security**: Ensure IAM users use MFA, make resources private to prevent unauthorized access.
  - **Monitoring**: Detect and enforce adherence to configurations.
- **Automation**: Necessary for managing configurations at scale, especially with a large number of resources.

### Well-Architected Framework
The Well-Architected Framework consists of six pillars: security, cost optimization, performance efficiency, operational excellence, reliability, and sustainability. Monitoring and logging are essential to achieving these pillars:
- **Security**: Logging actions is crucial for maintaining security.
- **Cost Optimization**: Metrics help visualize and optimize resource utilization.
- **Performance Efficiency**: Metrics ensure workloads meet performance standards.
- **Operational Excellence**: Automating and auditing configurations adhere to best practices.
- **Reliability**: Observing uptime and performance is key to reliability.
- **Sustainability**: Metrics help track the carbon footprint of your AWS resources.

### Exam Tips
- Understand the differences between metrics, logs, and configurations.
- Know examples of metrics and logs, and how they are used.
- Be familiar with the role of configuration management in security and operational excellence.
- Relate monitoring and logging practices to the six pillars of the Well-Architected Framework.
