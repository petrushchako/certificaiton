## Introducing the AWS Snow Family

### Migrating Terabytes or Pentabytes of Data
- Large amount of data that needs to migrate to AWS (10 TB or more)
- It will take a lot of time to transfer such amount of data over the internet, so that is where Snow Family comes in.
- **Snow Family** are physical devices designed to securely and efficiently transfer large amounts of data to AWS. And you would typically use these devices when your network bandwidth can't handle an online migration efficiently, either bacause the amount of data is so great and it would take too long or overload the network, or it could be that there simply is no consistent network in the location that you are operating in. 
- You isntall the device (i.e. `Snowball`) and the Snawball gets installed locally in your data center. You then transfer your data to the Snowball and then ship the Snowball device to AWS, so that the data can be uploaded to AWS storage of your choice. 

#### Snow Family Variations
- ***Snowball***<br>Great option if you've got **at least 10 TB** of data to migrate. It is basically a big box full of disks that you connect to your network and copy the data onto the device before shipping it back to AWS.
- ***Snowball Edge***<br>Great option if you have got **at least 10 TB** of data to migrate and you need local compute (to perform some processing on the data). 
- ***Snowmobile*** (largest)<br>Great option if you've got **more than 10 PB** of data to migrate. And this is a shipping container full of disks that is towed by a truck.
- ***Snowcone*** (Smallest)<br>Small and portable, military grade **8 TB HDD** or **14 TB SSD** storage. Weighs under 5 lbs (so it fits in the mailbox or in the backpack).
