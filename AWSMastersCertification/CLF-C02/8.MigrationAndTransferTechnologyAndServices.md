## Introducing the AWS Snow Family

### Migrating Terabytes or Pentabytes of Data
- Large amount of data that needs to migrate to AWS (10 TB or more)
- It will take a lot of time to transfer such amount of data over the internet, so that is where Snow Family comes in.
- **Snow Family** are physical devices designed to securely and efficiently transfer large amounts of data to AWS. And you would typically use these devices when your network bandwidth can't handle an online migration efficiently, either bacause the amount of data is so great and it would take too long or overload the network, or it could be that there simply is no consistent network in the location that you are operating in. 
- You isntall the device (i.e. `Snowball`) and the Snawball gets installed locally in your data center. You then transfer your data to the Snowball and then ship the Snowball device to AWS, so that the data can be uploaded to AWS storage of your choice. 

#### Snow Family Variations
- ***Snowball***<br>Great option if you've got **at least 10 TB** of data to migrate. It is basically a big box full of disks that you connect to your network and copy the data onto the device before shipping it back to AWS.
- ***Snowball Edge***<br>Great option if you have got **at least 10 TB** of data to migrate and you need local compute (to perform some processing on the data). 
- ***Snowmobile*** (largest)<br>Great option if you've got **more than 10 PB** of data to migrate. And this is a shipping container full of disks that is towed by a truck.
- ***Snowcone*** (Smallest)<br>Small and portable, military grade **8 TB HDD** or **14 TB SSD** storage. Weighs under 5 lbs (so it fits in the mailbox or in the backpack).

## Introducing AWS Application Migration Service

### What is AWS Application Migration Service?

AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) simplifies and accelerates the migration of applications to AWS. It enables you to rehost applications on AWS without making any changes to the applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers. Often referred to as "lift-and-shift" migration, this service replicates your on-premises applications and infrastructure to AWS, allowing you to run your applications on AWS infrastructure with minimal disruption and effort.

### How it works

1. **Install Replication Agent**:
   - Start by installing the AWS Replication Agent on each of the application servers you want to migrate. This agent is responsible for replicating the data from your source servers to AWS.
   
2. **Continuous Replication**:
   - Once the agent is installed, it begins continuous replication of your source servers' data to AWS. This ensures that the data is kept up to date with minimal latency, providing near-real-time replication.

3. **Launch Test Instances**:
   - Before performing the actual migration, you can launch test instances in AWS to validate the migration process and ensure that your applications function correctly in the AWS environment.

4. **Cutover and Launch**:
   - When you are ready to switch over to AWS, you can perform a cutover. During this process, the replication agent finalizes the data transfer, and you can launch your applications on AWS. The entire process ensures minimal downtime and disruption.

5. **Cost Management**:
   - You only pay for the AWS resources you use during and after the migration. The migration itself is free of charge for up to 90 days per server, giving you ample time to complete the migration process.
