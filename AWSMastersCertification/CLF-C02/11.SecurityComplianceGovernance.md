## Security: The Bigger Picture

### Key Considerations

Securing cloud environments hinges on addressing two fundamental questions:

1. **Who can access?**
   - Define and manage user identities and roles.
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms.

2. **What can they do?**
   - Assign permissions and policies to control actions.
   - Enforce the principle of least privilege to minimize access.

By focusing on these aspects, you can effectively safeguard your cloud infrastructure against unauthorized access and actions.

### The Well-Architected Framework: Security

Here are a few key tenets of Security pillar:
- Identity and Access Management
- Data Stewardship and Encryption
- Network Security
- Application Security
- Compliance
- Security Management

## What Do We Need To Secure on AWS?

The Shared Responsibility Model:
- **Customer** (responsibility for security `in` the cloud):
  - **Customer Data** (Retention, Encryption, Backups, Access)
  - **Platform, Applications, Identity & Access Managment**
  - **Operating System, Networking & Firewall Configuration**
  - **Encryption**:
    - Client-Side Data Encryption & Data Integrity Authentication
    - Server-Side Encryption (File System and/or Data)
    - Networking Traffic Protection (Encryption, Integrity, Identity)
- **AWS** (responsibility for security `of` the cloud)
  - **Managed Services** lets you transfer responsibility of Operating System, Networking, Firewall and Encryption to AWS (instead of managing it as a customer).
  <br>Example:<br>
  You could choose to host database from `EC2` instance, where OS, Networking,etc would be your responsibility. Or you could choose to use managed DB instance on AWS (i.e. `RDS`)
