## Security: The Bigger Picture

### Key Considerations

Securing cloud environments hinges on addressing two fundamental questions:

1. **Who can access?**
   - Define and manage user identities and roles.
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms.

2. **What can they do?**
   - Assign permissions and policies to control actions.
   - Enforce the principle of least privilege to minimize access.

By focusing on these aspects, you can effectively safeguard your cloud infrastructure against unauthorized access and actions.
