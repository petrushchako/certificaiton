## Security: The Bigger Picture

### Key Considerations

Securing cloud environments hinges on addressing two fundamental questions:

1. **Who can access?**
   - Define and manage user identities and roles.
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms.

2. **What can they do?**
   - Assign permissions and policies to control actions.
   - Enforce the principle of least privilege to minimize access.

By focusing on these aspects, you can effectively safeguard your cloud infrastructure against unauthorized access and actions.

### The Well-Architected Framework: Security

![](img/WellArchitectedFramework-Security.png)

Here are a few key tenets of Security pillar:
- Identity and Access Management
- Data Stewardship and Encryption
- Network Security
- Application Security
- Compliance
- Security Management

<br>



## What Do We Need To Secure on AWS?

The Shared Responsibility Model:
- **Customer** (responsibility for security `in` the cloud):
  - **Customer Data** (Retention, Encryption, Backups, Access)
  - **Platform, Applications, Identity & Access Managment**
  - **Operating System, Networking & Firewall Configuration**
  - **Encryption**:
    - Client-Side Data Encryption & Data Integrity Authentication
    - Server-Side Encryption (File System and/or Data)
    - Networking Traffic Protection (Encryption, Integrity, Identity)
- **AWS** (responsibility for security `of` the cloud)
  - **Managed Services** lets you transfer responsibility of Operating System, Networking, Firewall and Encryption to AWS (instead of managing it as a customer).
  <br>Example:<br>
  You could choose to host database from `EC2` instance, where OS, Networking,etc would be your responsibility. Or you could choose to use managed DB instance on AWS (i.e. `RDS`)

## Illustrating the Principle of Least Privilege

### Introduction

Before diving into the security services on AWS, it's crucial to understand the Principle of Least Privilege. This principle ensures that users and resources are granted only the permissions necessary to complete their tasks. Let's explore this concept using the World Pizza Company as an example.

### What is the Principle of Least Privilege?

The Principle of Least Privilege states that you should grant only the permissions needed to complete a task. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and accidental changes to sensitive data or critical systems.

### Examples from World Pizza Company

World Pizza Company has various resources:
- Front door (access control)
- Pizza oven (production)
- Point-of-sales system (orders)
- Safe (secret recipe storage)

Hereâ€™s how the Principle of Least Privilege applies to different employees:

1. **Pizza Cook**
   - Needs access only to the pizza oven.
   - Does not require access to the front door, point-of-sales system, or the safe.

2. **Customer Service Employee**
   - Needs access only to the point-of-sales system to take orders.
   - Does not require access to the pizza oven, front door, or the safe.

3. **Manager**
   - Needs access to the front door to open the store.
   - May need access to the point-of-sales system and pizza oven.
   - Does not require access to the safe.

4. **Owner (Sage)**
   - Needs access to all resources, including the front door, pizza oven, point-of-sales system, and the safe.

### Importance of the Principle of Least Privilege

#### Risk Mitigation

By applying the Principle of Least Privilege, the potential impact of a compromised identity is minimized. For instance, if a bad actor impersonates the pizza cook, they would only have access to the pizza oven, not to the safe or point-of-sales system, thereby reducing the risk of significant damage.

#### Preventing Accidents

Limiting access also reduces the likelihood of accidental data exposure or system misconfiguration. Fewer permissions mean fewer chances for unintended actions that could lead to security breaches.

### Granular Permissions

Granular permissions allow you to specify precise actions that users or applications can perform. For example:

- **Point-of-Sales System**
  - Employees: Can enter orders, open the cash drawer, edit menu items, refund transactions, and receive payments.
  - Customers: Can only place orders and make payments.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM) on AWS

IAM (Identity and Access Management) is the AWS service that helps you apply the Principle of Least Privilege by managing permissions for users, resources, and applications.

- **Users**: Define permissions for AWS users logging into your account.
- **Resources**: Restrict access to specific AWS resources.
- **Applications**: Grant applications permissions to access resources within AWS.

### Conclusion

By adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege and leveraging IAM, you can effectively control who can enter your AWS environment and what actions they can perform. This approach enhances security by minimizing both the risk of unauthorized access and the potential for accidental damage.

## IAM: Identity and Access Management
### Introduction
IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a crucial AWS service for controlling user access to your AWS account and resources. It ensures that the right people and resources have the appropriate access levels.

### Root User and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Root User**: The root user is the initial user created when setting up your AWS account. It has unrestricted access and is the only user capable of deleting the account. Keeping the root user secure is paramount.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA adds an extra layer of security. Even if an attacker obtains your username and password, they can't access your account without the MFA device. Enforcing MFA through IAM ensures only authenticated users can log in.

### Granular Permissions with IAM
IAM enables the definition of granular permissions. For example, at World Pizza Company:

- **Employees**: Can enter orders, open the cash drawer, change menu items, reverse transactions, and process payments.
- **Customers**: Can only place orders or make payments.

IAM policies define these permissions in AWS.

### IAM Policies
IAM policies are JSON documents that specify permissions for entities (users, groups, or roles). Here's a simple example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy grants full access to an S3 bucket and its contents. Policies can be applied to:

- **IAM Users**: Directly granting permissions to individual users.
- **IAM Groups**: Simplifying management by applying policies to groups, which automatically apply to all group members.
- **IAM Roles**: Allowing AWS resources or applications to assume roles with specified permissions. Roles automatically rotate their access keys, enhancing security.

### Access Methods
IAM users can access AWS resources through:
- **Console**: Using a username and password.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Using access keys.

### Best Practices
- **Access Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate access keys to minimize security risks. Long-lasting access keys increase the chance of being leaked.
- **Use IAM Roles**: Roles automatically rotate their keys, providing better security for applications and resources.

### Additional IAM Tools
- **IAM Access Analyzer**: Identifies resources with external access, validates policies, and generates policies based on usage to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
- **IAM Policy Simulator**: Allows testing policies before applying them to users, groups, or roles, ensuring they work as intended.

### Conclusion
IAM is essential for managing access and permissions in your AWS environment. By leveraging IAM policies, MFA, roles, and additional tools like Access Analyzer and Policy Simulator, you can ensure secure and efficient access control for all your AWS resources.

- **IAM Users vs. Federated Identity**: While you can create IAM users with unique usernames and passwords, federated identity allows you to use existing identity providers, such as Microsoft Active Directory, to grant access.
- **IAM Identity Center**: This service enables federated identity in AWS, providing a secure way to give users access to AWS resources by leveraging existing identity providers. Users log in via single sign-on (SSO) and temporarily assume IAM roles to access resources.

#### Key Benefits
- **Security**: IAM Identity Center is more secure than creating IAM users since it leverages roles that automatically rotate access keys.
- **Granular Permissions**: Define and attach IAM policies to roles for precise access control.

### Web Federated Identity with Amazon Cognito

- **Amazon Cognito**: This service allows developers to implement web federated identity for authentication. Users can log in with third-party web identity providers (e.g., Apple, Facebook, Google).
- **User Pools**: Create user pools in Amazon Cognito to manage user identities and grant temporary access to applications.
- **Enterprise Identity Providers**: In addition to social identity providers, Amazon Cognito supports enterprise identity providers for federated access.

### AWS Directory Service

- **Integration with Microsoft Active Directory**: AWS Directory Service connects your AWS environment with an existing Microsoft Active Directory.
- **Managed Active Directory**: If preferred, AWS Directory Service can manage Microsoft Active Directory within AWS.

### Temporary Access with Security Token Service (STS)

- **AWS STS**: This service is designed for granting temporary access to AWS resources.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for situations requiring temporary permissions, such as third-party audits.
  - **Temporary Roles**: Users assume temporary roles with defined access levels, which expire after a set period.

### Summary

AWS offers several tools and services to leverage existing identity providers, enhancing security and simplifying user management:

- **IAM Identity Center**: For federated identity using existing identity systems.

## Keeping Secrets Safe in AWS

#### Introduction

In AWS, keeping secrets safe involves protecting sensitive data that is valuable to your company or could be a liability if leaked. This includes customer data and other confidential information. The two main strategies for keeping secrets safe are encryption and secure storage of secret parameters.

### Encryption in AWS

#### Encryption at Rest

**Amazon S3**
- **Default Encryption**: By default, Amazon S3 uses server-side encryption with S3 managed keys for all new buckets.
- **Custom Key Management**: Users can disable default encryption and manage encryption keys through different sources, such as AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

**Amazon Macie**
- **Data Scanning**: Macie uses machine learning to scan S3 buckets for sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII). It helps identify and protect data that shouldn't be exposed.

**Elastic Block Store (EBS)**
- **Encryption**: EBS volumes can be encrypted using keys from KMS, protecting data stored on EC2 instances.

**Relational Database Service (RDS)**
- **Encryption**: RDS databases can be encrypted using KMS. Note that existing RDS instances cannot be encrypted directly; you must create a new encrypted copy.

By encrypting data at rest, you ensure that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read without the encryption key.

#### Encryption in Transit

**Amazon VPC**
- **Default Encryption**: All traffic within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is encrypted by default.

**Public Internet Traffic**
- **HTTPS Protocol**: Encrypts data in transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Ensure web applications support HTTPS to protect data moving over the internet.
- **AWS Certificate Manager**: Provisions and deploys TLS certificates to enable HTTPS on AWS-hosted web applications.

Using HTTPS ensures that data transmitted over the internet is secure and protected from interception.

### Secure Storage of Secret Parameters

**Systems Manager Parameter Store**
- **Purpose**: Stores secret parameters like usernames, passwords, and database strings.
- **Access Control**: EC2 instances and other resources can access these secrets programmatically, but only if they have the necessary IAM role.
- **Usage**: Securely store and reference sensitive values in your code.

**Secrets Manager**
- **Enhanced Security**: Similar to Parameter Store, but with additional features like automatic secret rotation.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for super-sensitive data where you want to ensure that even if a secret is discovered, it is quickly rotated to maintain security.

Secrets Manager allows for automated rotation of secrets, reducing the risk associated with long-lived credentials.

### Conclusion

AWS provides robust tools and services to keep secrets safe through encryption and secure parameter storage:

- **Encryption at Rest**: Utilize S3 default encryption, EBS and RDS encryption with KMS, and Amazon Macie for data scanning.
- **Encryption in Transit**: Ensure HTTPS for web applications using AWS Certificate Manager.
- **Secure Parameter Storage**: Use Systems Manager Parameter Store for basic secret management and Secrets Manager for advanced, auto-rotating secret storage.

By leveraging these AWS services, you can effectively protect sensitive data and maintain the security and integrity of your AWS environment.

## Governing Multiple Accounts in AWS

### Introduction
In AWS, an account is a collection of resources that many users can log into and contribute to. Unlike social media or email accounts, AWS accounts are not designed for single users but for managing and accessing resources collectively.

### The Challenge of Multi-Project Management

#### Scenario
Imagine you have a company with an AWS account for developing an application. Your company decides to start a second project. Instead of provisioning new resources within the same AWS account and managing complex IAM policies to separate access between teams, there's a better solution: creating separate AWS accounts for each project.

#### Solution
Splitting projects into their own AWS accounts ensures:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Team A cannot access Team B's resources and vice versa.
- **Clear Resource Management**: It's easier to see which resources belong to which project.
- **Accident Prevention**: Reduces the risk of accidentally affecting another team's resources.

This practice is not only simpler but is considered a best practice for managing multiple projects.
