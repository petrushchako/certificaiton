## Security: The Bigger Picture

### Key Considerations

Securing cloud environments hinges on addressing two fundamental questions:

1. **Who can access?**
   - Define and manage user identities and roles.
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms.

2. **What can they do?**
   - Assign permissions and policies to control actions.
   - Enforce the principle of least privilege to minimize access.

By focusing on these aspects, you can effectively safeguard your cloud infrastructure against unauthorized access and actions.

Here are a few key tenets of Security pillar:
- Identity and Access Management
- Data Stewardship and Encryption
- Network Security
- Application Security
- Compliance
- Security Management

## What Do We Need To Secure on AWS?

The Shared Responsibility Model:
- **Customer** (responsibility for security `in` the cloud):
  - **Customer Data** (Retention, Encryption, Backups, Access)
  - **Platform, Applications, Identity & Access Managment**
  - **Operating System, Networking & Firewall Configuration**
  - **Encryption**:
    - Client-Side Data Encryption & Data Integrity Authentication
    - Server-Side Encryption (File System and/or Data)
    - Networking Traffic Protection (Encryption, Integrity, Identity)
- **AWS** (responsibility for security `of` the cloud)
  - **Managed Services** lets you transfer responsibility of Operating System, Networking, Firewall and Encryption to AWS (instead of managing it as a customer).
  <br>Example:<br>
  You could choose to host database from `EC2` instance, where OS, Networking,etc would be your responsibility. Or you could choose to use managed DB instance on AWS (i.e. `RDS`)

## Illustrating the Principle of Least Privilege

### Introduction

Before diving into the security services on AWS, it's crucial to understand the Principle of Least Privilege. This principle ensures that users and resources are granted only the permissions necessary to complete their tasks. Let's explore this concept using the World Pizza Company as an example.

### What is the Principle of Least Privilege?

The Principle of Least Privilege states that you should grant only the permissions needed to complete a task. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and accidental changes to sensitive data or critical systems.

### Examples from World Pizza Company

World Pizza Company has various resources:
- Front door (access control)
- Pizza oven (production)
- Point-of-sales system (orders)
- Safe (secret recipe storage)

Hereâ€™s how the Principle of Least Privilege applies to different employees:

1. **Pizza Cook**
   - Needs access only to the pizza oven.
   - Does not require access to the front door, point-of-sales system, or the safe.

2. **Customer Service Employee**
   - Needs access only to the point-of-sales system to take orders.
   - Does not require access to the pizza oven, front door, or the safe.

3. **Manager**
   - Needs access to the front door to open the store.
   - May need access to the point-of-sales system and pizza oven.
   - Does not require access to the safe.

4. **Owner (Sage)**
   - Needs access to all resources, including the front door, pizza oven, point-of-sales system, and the safe.

### Importance of the Principle of Least Privilege

#### Risk Mitigation

By applying the Principle of Least Privilege, the potential impact of a compromised identity is minimized. For instance, if a bad actor impersonates the pizza cook, they would only have access to the pizza oven, not to the safe or point-of-sales system, thereby reducing the risk of significant damage.

#### Preventing Accidents

Limiting access also reduces the likelihood of accidental data exposure or system misconfiguration. Fewer permissions mean fewer chances for unintended actions that could lead to security breaches.

### Granular Permissions

Granular permissions allow you to specify precise actions that users or applications can perform. For example:

- **Point-of-Sales System**
  - Employees: Can enter orders, open the cash drawer, edit menu items, refund transactions, and receive payments.
  - Customers: Can only place orders and make payments.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM) on AWS

IAM (Identity and Access Management) is the AWS service that helps you apply the Principle of Least Privilege by managing permissions for users, resources, and applications.

- **Users**: Define permissions for AWS users logging into your account.
- **Resources**: Restrict access to specific AWS resources.
- **Applications**: Grant applications permissions to access resources within AWS.

### Conclusion

By adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege and leveraging IAM, you can effectively control who can enter your AWS environment and what actions they can perform. This approach enhances security by minimizing both the risk of unauthorized access and the potential for accidental damage.
