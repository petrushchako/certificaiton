## Networking: The Bigger Picture

### What is Amazon VPC
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. It provides complete control over your virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security. You can define your own IP address range, create subnets, configure route tables, and network gateways. Amazon VPC allows you to extend your corporate data center to the cloud while maintaining the security and management controls that you are used to.

![](img/VPC.png)

### Key Components of a VPC
- **Subnets**: 
  - Logical subdivisions of an IP network within a VPC. Each subnet resides within a single Availability Zone. Subnets can be designated as public or private to control access to resources.
  
- **Internet Gateways**:
  - Horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IP addresses.
  
- **NAT Gateways/Bastion Hosts**:
  - **NAT Gateway**: Allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services but prevents the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.
  - **Bastion Host**: A special-purpose instance that is used to access instances in a private subnet. This host is typically placed in a public subnet and accessed via SSH or RDP.

- **Route Tables**:
  - Contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table, which controls the routing for the subnet.

- **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**:
  - Optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. NACLs provide a rule-based tool to control network traffic, operating at the subnet level.

- **Security Groups**:
  - Act as virtual firewalls for instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups are associated with network interfaces and control the flow of traffic to and from the associated instances.

### Understanding Subnets in a VPC
- **Public Subnets**:
  - Resources here can be accessed from the internet.
  - Public subnets are typically associated with route tables that have a route to an internet gateway, allowing resources in these subnets to access and be accessed from the internet.
  - Suitable for resources that need to be publicly accessible, such as web servers.

- **Private Subnets**:
  - Not directly accessible from the outside world.
  - Private subnets might have routes that keep traffic contained within the VPC or routed to corporate networks via VPN or AWS Direct Connect.
  - Suitable for resources that should not be accessible from the internet, such as databases.

### Internet Gateways & Route Tables
- **Internet Gateway**:
  - Responsible for routing outgoing requests and incoming traffic.
  - Provides a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic and performs network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IP addresses.
  - Must be attached to your VPC to enable internet access.

- **Route Table**:
  - Have entries (routes) that determine where network traffic from your subnets should go.
  - Each subnet must be associated with a route table. Subnets use the route table to determine how to reach other networks, including the internet or other subnets within the VPC.
  - Route tables can be explicitly associated with a subnet, or a default route table is used.

### Security in Your VPC
- **Security Group**:
  - Acts like a guideline for what is allowed in and out of each area of your kitchen.
  - Security groups make decisions about who can enter and exit. Operating at the instance level, security groups are like virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for each instance.
  - They allow you to specify allowable protocols, ports, and source or destination IP ranges.
  - **Importantly**, security groups are stateful. This means if they allow traffic in one direction, the return traffic is automatically allowed regardless of the inbound rules.
  - You can create inbound and outbound rules to control traffic, but once a connection is allowed, the return traffic is automatically permitted.

- **Network Access Control List (NACL)**:
  - Network ACLs serve as an extra layer of security providing a set of rules that control traffic in and out of the subnets.
  - NACLs are like the guards at the gate of your community, like your subnets. They operate at the subnet level and provide a layer of defense for all instances within the subnet.
  - **Importantly**, NACLs are stateless, which means they don't remember previous interactions. Inbound and outbound rules must be set separately to control the traffic entering and leaving the subnet.
  - They can allow or deny traffic based on protocol, port, and source or destination IP addresses.
  - NACLs are useful for adding an extra layer of security to the subnets, complementing security groups.

> **Security Group vs Network Access Control List**
> The main difference lies in their scope and statefulness. Security groups are more granular, controlling access to individual instances and maintaining state, while NACLs provide a broader layer of defense for subnets without maintaining state. Security groups are ideal for instance-level security, while NACLs are better suited for subnet-level security.
