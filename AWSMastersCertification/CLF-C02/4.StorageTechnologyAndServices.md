## Exploring Amazon EC2 Storage

### What is EC2?

Before we dive into storage, let's revisit EC2 quickly.
- EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.
- Imagine that every application we build is like creating a customized pizza. We'll look at EC2 like a main kitchen where we make the pizza. The size of the kitchen, the number of chefs, and the tools determine how fast we can make pizzas and how many at a time.
  
  
EC2 offers various storage options to cater to diverse needs.
Let's explore these.

### Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
EBS provides persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances.

#### Key Features
- High Availability and Durability
  - Suited for EC2 instances
  - Ensures data is preserved even if the instance crashes
- Scalability
  - Expands on-the-gly without any downtime
- Snapshot
  - Can take backups and also use these backups to create new volumes

#### EBS Use Cases
- Hosting relational or NoSQL databases
- Data warehousing and big data analytics
- ERP and CRM applications

### Elastic File System (EFS)
Imagine a pizza conveyor system that can serve many kitchens, or EC2 instances, it's shared, and chefs from multiple kitchens can access pizzas from it.

EFS is a scalable file storage solution for EC2 and other AWS services.

#### Key Features
- Fully Managed
  - Removes the complexity of deploying and maintaining file systems
- Automatic Scailing
  - Automatically scales on demand without disrupting applications
- Concurrent Access
  - Multiple EC2 instances can access an EFS simultaneously.

#### EFS Use Cases
EFS is perfect for applications with growing storage needs
- Content management and serb serving
- Data analytics applications
- Deployment and testing environments

### Instance Stores
- These offer temporary block level storage directly attached to the EC2 instance.
- Unlike EBS, the storage is ephemeral, and it's ideal for temporary data.
- Instance stores are like a temporary prep table, you prepare your ingredients, or data, here, but if you shut down the kitchen or terminate the instance, the prep is gone.

#### Key Features
- High I/O Performance
  - Offers very high input/output operations per second
- Temporary Storage
  - Data is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated
- No Extra Cost
  - They come as part of the instance

#### Instance Stores Use Cases
- Temporary storage of cache and buffers
- Write and discard large amounts of data
- Storage for applications that replicate data across multiple instances
