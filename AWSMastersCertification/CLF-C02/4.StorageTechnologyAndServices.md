## Exploring Amazon EC2 Storage

### What is EC2?

Before we dive into storage, let's revisit EC2 quickly.
- EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.
- Imagine that every application we build is like creating a customized pizza. We'll look at EC2 like a main kitchen where we make the pizza. The size of the kitchen, the number of chefs, and the tools determine how fast we can make pizzas and how many at a time.
  
  
EC2 offers various storage options to cater to diverse needs.
Let's explore these.

### Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
EBS provides persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances.

#### Key Features
- **Persistence**
    - EBS volumes persist independently from the running life of an EC2 instance. This means that if you stop or terminate an instance, the EBS volume remains and can be re-attached to another instance.
- **Types of EBS Volumes**
    - General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2): Suitable for a broad range of workloads, including boot volumes and development environments.
    - Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2, io1): Designed for mission-critical applications that require high performance, such as databases.
    - Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): Ideal for large, sequential workloads such as big data and data warehouses.
    - Cold HDD (sc1): Suitable for less frequently accessed data, providing low-cost storage.
- **Snapshots**
    - EBS supports point-in-time snapshots of volumes, which are stored in Amazon S3. These snapshots can be used to create new EBS volumes, enabling easy backup and recovery.
- **Elasticity**
    - You can dynamically increase capacity, tune performance, and change the type of EBS volume on-the-fly without disrupting your applications.

#### EBS Use Cases
- Hosting relational or NoSQL databases
- Data warehousing and big data analytics
- ERP and CRM applications

### Elastic File System (EFS)
Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a scalable file storage service for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is not typically used as a default storage for EC2 instances at creation but is available for creating shared file systems that can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances.

#### Key Features
- Fully Managed
  - Removes the complexity of deploying and maintaining file systems
- Automatic Scailing
  - Automatically scales on demand without disrupting applications
- Concurrent Access
  - Multiple EC2 instances can access an EFS simultaneously.

#### EFS Use Cases
EFS is perfect for applications with growing storage needs
- Content management and serb serving
- Data analytics applications
- Deployment and testing environments

### Instance Stores
- These offer temporary block level storage directly attached to the EC2 instance.
- Unlike EBS, the storage is ephemeral, and it's ideal for temporary data.
- Instance stores are like a temporary prep table, you prepare your ingredients, or data, here, but if you shut down the kitchen or terminate the instance, the prep is gone.

#### Key Features
- **Ephemeral**
    - Data on instance store volumes is lost if the instance is stopped, terminated, or fails. This makes it suitable only for temporary data that can be recreated or is replicated elsewhere.
- **Performance**
    - Instance store volumes can provide very high I/O performance, often used for caching, temporary data, and buffers.
- **Non-persistent**
    - Unlike EBS volumes, instance store volumes are directly attached to the physical hardware of the host computer, leading to faster I/O operations but lacking persistence across instance stops and starts.
- **No Extra Cost**
    - They come as part of the instance

#### Instance Stores Use Cases
- Temporary storage of cache and buffers
- Write and discard large amounts of data
- Storage for applications that replicate data across multiple instances
