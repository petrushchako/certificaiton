## Exploring Amazon EC2 Storage

### What is EC2?

Before we dive into storage, let's revisit EC2 quickly.
- EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.
- Imagine that every application we build is like creating a customized pizza. We'll look at EC2 like a main kitchen where we make the pizza. The size of the kitchen, the number of chefs, and the tools determine how fast we can make pizzas and how many at a time.
  
  
EC2 offers various storage options to cater to diverse needs.
Let's explore these.

### Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
EBS provides persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances.

#### Key Features
- High Availability and Durability
  - Suited for EC2 instances
  - Ensures data is preserved even if the instance crashes
- Scalability
  - Expands on-the-gly without any downtime
- Snapshot
  - Can take backups and also use these backups to create new volumes

### EBS Use Cases
- Hosting relational or NoSQL databases
- Data warehousing and big data analytics
- ERP and CRM applications
