# Troubleshooting an IAM Policy on an EC2 Instance

### ABOUT THIS LAB
In this lab you will be taking on the role of a cloud engineer. You come to realize your EC2 instance is unable to get items from your S3 bucket. All of the network settings appear to be correct, so you need to determine how to give your EC2 instance permission to access the S3 bucket.

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
- Upload an object to the S3 bucket.
- Connect to the EC2 instance and attempt to get the object
- Connect to the EC2 instance to verify the new permissions
- Edit the instanceâ€™s IAM Policy to allow access to the S3 Bucket
