# Create a DynamoDB Table Using CloudFormation

### ABOUT THIS LAB
In this lab scenario, Alfredo of Alfredo's Pizza is building a web application to manage his supply and food inventory. He's looking for help to provision his database infrastructure, which will hold his data. You'll use CloudFormation to write the desired state of the infrastructure using code, which includes a DynamoDB table to hold inventory items. Youâ€™ll first launch the resources in his development environment, but the template can later be used to launch a stack in the test and production environments as well. By the end of this lab, you'll have a good understanding of infrastructure as code using CloudFormation.

8. Click `Next`.
9. For `Stack name`, enter `MyStack`.
10. Click `Next`.

12. On the `Review and create` page, click `Submit`.
13. Click the refresh icon in the upper-right section of the `Events` list to check the status of the stack being created.
> Note: It will take a few minutes for the stack to create. You can view the progress of the stack creation in the Status column of the Events list.

### Verify the DynamoDB Table Was Created
1. Once the stack is created, use the top search bar within the console to search for and navigate to `DynamoDB`.
2. From the left menu, click `Tables`.
