# Launch EC2 Instance in VPC

### ABOUT THIS LAB
In this lab scenario, Alfredo of Alfredo's Pizza is looking to set up a website to advertise his pizza shop. We are going to help him by getting the server primed and ready to host his website. During this lab, you'll have the opportunity to explore and understand foundational and compute services provided by AWS. We will create a virtual private cloud (VPC), subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), routes and an internet gateway, and more. These services are the foundation of networking architecture inside of AWS and cover concepts such as infrastructure, design, routing, and security.
