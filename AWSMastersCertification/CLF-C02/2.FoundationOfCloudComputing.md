## Getting Your Head in the Cloud

### What is the cloud?

**Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and store data, run applications, and perform computing tasks over the internet, rather than on local servers or personal computers.<br>It provides on-demand availability of computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics. Cloud services are typically offered by providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, which manage the underlying infrastructure and provide scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions.

**Virtualization in Cloud Computing**

Virtualization is a key technology in cloud computing that optimizes the utilization of servers. It involves creating virtual versions of physical hardware, such as servers, storage devices, and network resources. By using virtualization, multiple virtual machines (VMs) can run on a single physical server, each operating independently and with its own operating system and applications. This maximizes resource efficiency, as it allows for better allocation and management of computing power, reduces hardware costs, and enhances scalability and flexibility. Virtualization also improves disaster recovery and simplifies IT management, contributing to the overall effectiveness and reliability of cloud services.

## Introducing Cloud Computing and Deployment Models
#### Capital expenditures (CapEx)
Capital expenditures are the upfront purchases towards fixed assets

#### Operating Expenses (OpEx)
Operating expenses are funds used to run day-to-day operations

<br>

### Cloud computing advantages
- Global in minutes (easy and fast setup)
- No Data center purachasing/investment
- Economies of scale (pricing of services provided by cloud providers)
- Speed and agility
- Stop guessing capacity (Cloud elasticity)
- CapEx for variable Expense

### Cloud computing benefits
- High Availability
- Elasticity<br>Easy to automate or manually add additional resources when required
- Agility<br>All the services you have available to you, make you inovate faster
- Durability<br>Long-term data protection
  
### Cloud Computing Models

<br>

### Exploring Regions and Availability Zones
- **AWS Region**<br>Is a physical location. AWS groups their regions by geographic locations and can include several regions within each location (Ohio and North Verginia reside under the US East geographic location).
  - Region Characteristics:
    - Fully isolated and independent, meaning that if one region is impacted by, let's say, an earthquake, the others will not be. 
    - Regions are resource and service specific, meaning that they are isolated and resources are not automatically replicated across them. You would need to replicate any resource in each region.
- **AWS Availability Zones**<br>One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. AWS regions consist of multiple availability zones, which consist of one ore more physically separated data centers. 
  - Availability zones within a region are connected to each other through low latency links
  - Fault tolerant<br>AZs are fault tolerant, meaning that if one AZ goes out of service, the others should not be impacted.
  - High availability<br>AZs also allow for high availability, which we discussed in previous section. 

<br>

## Reviewing Edge Locations and Local Zones

**Latency**<br>The time that passes between a user request and the resulting response.

**Local Zones**<br>Place AWS services closer to end-user.<br>It allow for any application that reqiores millisecond latencies.<br>Local Zones are extensions of Regions and provide high bandwidth and secure connections between local wlorkloads and those running in actual Region

**Edge Locations**<br>Edge locations can help to reduce latency. They are not used to launch resources, but instead will cache content for faster delivery to users, and are a feature provided by CloudFront service.<br>Edge Locations uses the AWS backbone network.

## Introducing the Frameworks

### Cloud Adaption Framework Overview

<br>

### Cloud Transformation Domains
- **Technology**<br>Migrate and modernize (move legacy infrastructure to cloud)
- **Process Transformation**<br>Focuses on digitizing, automating and optimizing your busienss operations. 
- **Organization**<br>Focuses on reimagining how the business and teams orchestrate their efforts to create more value, and meet goals. 
- **Product transformation**<br>Focuses on reimagining your business model by creating new products or services and revenue models.

<br>

### Cloud Transformation Journey Phases
- **Envision**<br>The envision phase focuses on demonstrating how to use the cloud to accelerate business outcomes. 
- **Align**<br>Focuses on identifying capability gaps across the six perspectives we covered. This includes identifying cross organizational dependencies and finding any challenges or areas of concern.
- **Launch**<br>Focuses on delivering our pilot transformations and demonstrating their values. This is where we observe and adjust before moving on to the next phase.
- **Scaling**<br>Focuses on expanding those transformations accross our environment and scaling them out to meet our requirements and goals.
