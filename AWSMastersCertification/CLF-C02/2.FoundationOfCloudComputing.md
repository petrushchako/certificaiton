## Getting Your Head in the Cloud

### What is the cloud?

**Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and store data, run applications, and perform computing tasks over the internet, rather than on local servers or personal computers.<br>It provides on-demand availability of computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics. Cloud services are typically offered by providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, which manage the underlying infrastructure and provide scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions.

**Virtualization in Cloud Computing**

Virtualization is a key technology in cloud computing that optimizes the utilization of servers. It involves creating virtual versions of physical hardware, such as servers, storage devices, and network resources. By using virtualization, multiple virtual machines (VMs) can run on a single physical server, each operating independently and with its own operating system and applications. This maximizes resource efficiency, as it allows for better allocation and management of computing power, reduces hardware costs, and enhances scalability and flexibility. Virtualization also improves disaster recovery and simplifies IT management, contributing to the overall effectiveness and reliability of cloud services.
