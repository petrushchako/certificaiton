## Getting Your Head in the Cloud

### What is the cloud?

**Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and store data, run applications, and perform computing tasks over the internet, rather than on local servers or personal computers.<br>It provides on-demand availability of computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics. Cloud services are typically offered by providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, which manage the underlying infrastructure and provide scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions.

**Virtualization in Cloud Computing**

Virtualization is a key technology in cloud computing that optimizes the utilization of servers. It involves creating virtual versions of physical hardware, such as servers, storage devices, and network resources. By using virtualization, multiple virtual machines (VMs) can run on a single physical server, each operating independently and with its own operating system and applications. This maximizes resource efficiency, as it allows for better allocation and management of computing power, reduces hardware costs, and enhances scalability and flexibility. Virtualization also improves disaster recovery and simplifies IT management, contributing to the overall effectiveness and reliability of cloud services.

<br>

### Exploring Regions and Availability Zones
- **AWS Region**<br>Is a physical location. AWS groups their regions by geographic locations and can include several regions within each location (Ohio and North Verginia reside under the US East geographic location).
  - Region Characteristics:
    - Fully isolated and independent, meaning that if one region is impacted by, let's say, an earthquake, the others will not be. 
    - Regions are resource and service specific, meaning that they are isolated and resources are not automatically replicated across them. You would need to replicate any resource in each region.
- **AWS Availability Zones**<br>One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. AWS regions consist of multiple availability zones, which consist of one ore more physically separated data centers. 
  - Availability zones within a region are connected to each other through low latency links
  - Fault tolerant<br>AZs are fault tolerant, meaning that if one AZ goes out of service, the others should not be impacted.
  - High availability<br>AZs also allow for high availability, which we discussed in previous section. 

<br>

## Reviewing Edge Locations and Local Zones

**Latency**<br>The time that passes between a user request and the resulting response.

**Local Zones**<br>Place AWS services closer to end-user.<br>It allow for any application that reqiores millisecond latencies.<br>Local Zones are extensions of Regions and provide high bandwidth and secure connections between local wlorkloads and those running in actual Region

**Edge Locations**<br>Edge locations can help to reduce latency. They are not used to launch resources, but instead will cache content for faster delivery to users, and are a feature provided by CloudFront service.<br>Edge Locations uses the AWS backbone network.

### General Design Principles
- **Stop Guessing Your Capacity Needs**
  
    Collect and use data to understand what your capacity needs are prior to implementation in the cloud. Auto scaling can help with this

- **Test Systems At Production Scale**

    Meaning create a complete testing environment to simulate your actual workload, and don't forget to decommission it when your testing is all done.

- **Consider Evolutionary Architectures**

    Allow your architecture to evolve as the needs of the workload grows or shrinks. This also includes the ability to adopt new offerings as capabilities change.

- **Automate with Architectural Experimentation in Mind**

    Automation can save time and money while implementing a faster way to create and replicate your workloads. It can help with disaster recovery using automatic failovers, and reduce the impact of any incidents.

- **Drive Architectures Using Data**

    As you collect data about usage to determine your capacity needs,you should also be collecting it to observe how architectural choices are affecting your workload. Use that data to improve architecture over time.

- **Improve Through Game Days**

    Game days help to simulate events so that your team can be ready for the real deal. Cutting back on time, perfecting processes and finding faults  and performance.

## Meeting the AWS Management Console and Accessing AWS

### AWS Management Console

![](img/awsManagementConsole.png)

<br>

### Root User
The AWS root user is the initial account created when you first set up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. This account has unrestricted access to all AWS services and resources in the account. The root user has complete control over the entire AWS environment, including billing information, account settings, and all service permissions.

#### Key Characteristics of the AWS Root User
1. **Full Access**:
    - The root user has full access to all resources and services in the AWS account.
    - It can perform any action on any service, including creating, modifying, and deleting resources.

2. **Account Management**:
    - The root user can manage account settings, including changing contact information, payment methods, and billing preferences.
    - It is the only user that can close the AWS account.

3. **Security and Compliance**:
    - Due to its powerful permissions, the root user is a critical security component.
    - It's recommended to use the root user only for tasks that require root-level access and to follow best practices for securing the account.

#### Best Practices for AWS Root User
1. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
    - Enable MFA on the root account to add an extra layer of security. This requires a second form of authentication in addition to the password.
2. **Use Strong Passwords**:
    - Use a strong, unique password for the root user to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Limit Root User Usage**:
    - Avoid using the root user for day-to-day operations. Instead, create AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and assign them the necessary permissions.
4. **Monitor Root User Activity**:
    - Regularly monitor root user activity through AWS CloudTrail to detect any unauthorized actions.
5. **Delegate Administrative Tasks**:
    - Create IAM users with administrative privileges to perform tasks that do not require root access.
6. **Secure Root User Credentials**:
    - Store root user credentials securely and do not share them. Ensure that only trusted individuals have access to them.

#### Common Tasks for the Root User
1. **Account Closure**:
    - Only the root user can close the AWS account.
2. Billing and Payment Management:
    - The root user can update payment methods, view bills, and manage billing alerts.
3. Service Limit Requests:
    - Some service limit increase requests must be made by the root user.
4. Creating the First IAM Admin User:
    - Upon setting up an AWS account, the root user can create the first IAM admin user who will manage the account moving forward.

#### Summary
The AWS root user is a powerful and essential component of an AWS account with unrestricted access to all services and resources. To maintain security, it is crucial to enable MFA, use strong passwords, limit the use of the root account, and monitor its activity. For everyday tasks, the creation and use of IAM users with appropriate permissions is recommended.
