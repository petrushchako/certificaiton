## Compute: The Bigger Picture
### Compute Overview
Compute is used to describe concepts and services geared towards computation and processing. 

#### Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
Elastic means that it can grow and shrink. If your needs or loads on your application grow, your EC2 instances can grow as well and when that needs subsides, it can shrink down to save money and meet sustainability goals.<br>EC2 is a virtual server in the cloud, and runs on a pphysical server within a datacenter, within AZ within whatever region we selected.<br>EC2 is a fundational service that you use to manage your virtual instances. 

EC2 is a fundational service that you use to manage your virtual instances. This allows you to provision them with a simple click of a button useing a template that we call a **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**. This template has important information, including the operating system used. You can also deploy your applications directly to EC2 instances using multiple AZs for highly available application, or use EC2 as a database to have full control over that database. 

#### EC2 Six families

EC2 offers six families of instances that are broken up into types, generations, and sizes, which make up hundreds of options that you can select within the service. 

- General Purpose
- Compute Optimized
- Memory Optimized
- Accelerated Computing
- Storage Optimized
- High Performance Computing (HPC) Optimized

## Review EC2 Features
### Load Balancing

Load Balancing automatically disctributes your incoming traffic across multiple healthy EC2 instances. 

**There are 4 load balancer types:**
1. Classic
    - EC2-Classic network
    - On Layer 4 and 7
    - TCP, SSL/TLS, HTTP/S protocol listeners
2. Application
    - Flexible application management
    - Layer 7 
    - HTTP/S and GRPC
3. Gateway
    - Used for network logging and monitoring with third-party virtual appliances
    - On Layers 3 (gateway) and 4 (load balancer)
    - Because it works at the gateway level, it only has IP protocol listeners, SO you won't use this one for many use cases.
4. Network
    - Extreme performance and static IP addresses
    - Layer 4
    - TCP, UDP and TLS
   
Each of them direct traffic, the difference lie in what type of traffic they handle and when to use them.

### Auto Scaling
Adds or replaces EC2 instances automatically across AZs

- **Horizontal**<br>Horizontal scaling or scaling out reduces the impact of system failures and improves availability of your applications as it uses multiple AZs.<br>It adds or removes more instances 
- **Vertical**<br>Vertical scaling Or scaling up upgrades your EC2 instances by adding more power or CPU and RAM to an existing server like going from a T3 small to a T3 medium instance. 

<br>

### Compute Optimizer
Compute Optimizer can help you to rightsize your instances, volumes, containers or lambda functions based on data from your usage. 

It provides recommendations on how to improve performance and indentify under-perovisioned or over-provisioned resources.

You can improve recommendations for auto scaling groups in instances by using historical data and any third party metrics collected from other application performance monitoring tools.

Compute Optimizer can also help to streamline migration to Graviton CPUs if you're needing to cut costs and improve performance by using Graviton.

## Containers: The Bigger Picture

**Container**

A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers provide a consistent and isolated environment for applications to run, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This makes them highly portable and ensures that applications run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another, such as from a developer's laptop to a test environment, or from staging to production.

#### Key Characteristics of Containers

1. **Isolation**:
   - Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, isolating them from the host system and other containers.
   - This isolation ensures that an application in one container does not interfere with applications in other containers.

2. **Portability**:
   - Containers can run consistently across various environments, including different cloud providers, on-premises data centers, and developer machines.
   - This portability is achieved because containers package the application and all its dependencies together.

3. **Lightweight**:
   - Containers share the host system's operating system kernel, making them more efficient and less resource-intensive compared to traditional virtual machines (VMs).
   - This lightweight nature allows for higher density and more efficient use of resources.

4. **Consistency**:
   - Containers ensure that the software runs the same way regardless of where it is deployed, reducing the "works on my machine" problem.
   - This consistency is critical for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

5. **Scalability**:
   - Containers can be quickly started, stopped, and scaled up or down to handle varying loads, making them ideal for microservices architectures and dynamic environments.
   - Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes facilitate automated scaling and management of containerized applications.

#### Benefits of Using Containers

1. **Efficiency**:
   - Containers use fewer resources than VMs because they do not require a full guest operating system. This leads to better performance and cost savings.
   - They also start and stop much faster than VMs.

2. **Improved Development and Deployment**:
   - Developers can create consistent environments across development, testing, and production, leading to faster and more reliable deployments.
   - Containers facilitate DevOps practices by enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

3. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Containers provide process and resource isolation, enhancing security by limiting the attack surface.
   - They can be configured to run with minimal privileges, reducing the risk of exploitation.

4. **Simplified Management**:
   - Tools and platforms like Docker and Kubernetes provide powerful capabilities to build, manage, and orchestrate containers at scale.
   - Containers make it easier to manage dependencies and versioning for applications.

#### Common Use Cases for Containers

1. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Containers are ideal for building microservices, where each service can run in its own container, independently of others.
   - This modular approach improves scalability, fault isolation, and ease of maintenance.

2. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Containers streamline the CI/CD pipeline by providing consistent environments for building, testing, and deploying applications.
   - This consistency reduces deployment errors and accelerates delivery cycles.

3. **Application Modernization**:
   - Legacy applications can be containerized to improve portability and scalability, enabling a smoother transition to cloud environments.
   - Containers facilitate gradual modernization by allowing parts of the application to be updated independently.

4. **Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Deployments**:
   - Containers simplify the deployment and management of applications across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments.
   - This flexibility supports hybrid cloud strategies and helps avoid vendor lock-in.

#### Summary

Containers are a powerful tool in modern IT, providing isolated, portable, and consistent environments for running applications. They offer numerous benefits, including improved efficiency, enhanced security, and simplified management, making them ideal for various use cases such as microservices, CI/CD pipelines, application modernization, and hybrid cloud deployments.

## Serverless Services: The Bigger Picture
**Serverless Computing**

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. In this model, developers can build and run applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. The term "serverless" is somewhat of a misnomer because servers are still involved; however, the server management, including scaling, patching, and maintenance, is abstracted away from the developer.

#### Key Characteristics of Serverless Computing

1. **No Server Management**:
   - Developers do not need to provision, scale, or manage servers. All these tasks are handled by the cloud provider.

2. **Event-Driven Execution**:
   - Serverless functions are typically triggered by events, such as HTTP requests, database updates, file uploads, or scheduled tasks.
   - Each function execution is stateless and independent.

3. **Automatic Scaling**:
   - Serverless platforms automatically scale the compute resources up and down based on demand.
   - This ensures that the application can handle varying loads without manual intervention.

4. **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing**:
   - Users are billed based on the actual compute resources consumed by the application, rather than pre-allocated capacity.
   - This can lead to cost savings, especially for applications with unpredictable or variable workloads.

5. **Microservices Friendly**:
   - Serverless architectures promote the use of small, independent functions that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
   - This aligns well with microservices and event-driven architectures.

#### Popular Serverless Platforms

1. **AWS Lambda**:
   - Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers AWS Lambda, which allows users to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers.

2. **Azure Functions**:
   - Microsoft Azure provides Azure Functions, enabling event-driven serverless compute capabilities.

3. **Google Cloud Functions**:
   - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers Google Cloud Functions for running code in response to cloud events.

4. **IBM Cloud Functions**:
   - IBM offers IBM Cloud Functions, based on the Apache OpenWhisk open-source project.

#### Benefits of Serverless Computing

1. **Reduced Operational Complexity**:
   - Developers can focus on writing code and business logic rather than managing infrastructure.
   - Simplifies deployment and scaling processes.

2. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Billing is based on actual usage, so there are no costs for idle resources.
   - Ideal for applications with variable or unpredictable workloads.

3. **Scalability and Resilience**:
   - Automatic scaling ensures that applications can handle sudden spikes in traffic without performance degradation.
   - Functions are stateless and isolated, improving fault tolerance.

4. **Faster Time to Market**:
   - Developers can quickly deploy and iterate on individual functions without the overhead of managing infrastructure.
   - Accelerates development cycles and reduces time to market for new features.

#### Common Use Cases for Serverless Computing

1. **Web and Mobile Backends**:
   - Handling HTTP requests and APIs, user authentication, and backend logic for web and mobile applications.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Processing streams of data in real-time, such as log processing, ETL (extract, transform, load) tasks, and data transformation.

3. **Automation and Orchestration**:
   - Automating tasks like file processing, scheduled jobs, and workflows triggered by events.

4. **IoT Backends**:
   - Managing and processing data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including real-time analytics and control.

5. **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**:
   - Running conversational logic and integrations with messaging platforms and services.

#### Summary

Serverless computing is a cloud execution model that abstracts server management, enabling developers to focus on code while the cloud provider handles the infrastructure. It offers benefits such as reduced operational complexity, cost efficiency, automatic scalability, and faster development cycles. Serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and IBM Cloud Functions support a wide range of use cases, from web backends to real-time data processing and automation.
