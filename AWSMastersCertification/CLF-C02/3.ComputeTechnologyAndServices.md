## Compute: The Bigger Picture
### Compute Overview
Compute is used to describe concepts and services geared towards computation and processing. 

#### Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
Elastic means that it can grow and shrink. If your needs or loads on your application grow, your EC2 instances can grow as well and when that needs subsides, it can shrink down to save money and meet sustainability goals.<br>EC2 is a virtual server in the cloud, and runs on a pphysical server within a datacenter, within AZ within whatever region we selected.<br>EC2 is a fundational service that you use to manage your virtual instances. 

EC2 is a fundational service that you use to manage your virtual instances. This allows you to provision them with a simple click of a button useing a template that we call a **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**. This template has important information, including the operating system used. You can also deploy your applications directly to EC2 instances using multiple AZs for highly available application, or use EC2 as a database to have full control over that database. 

#### EC2 Six families

EC2 offers six families of instances that are broken up into types, generations, and sizes, which make up hundreds of options that you can select within the service. 

- General Purpose
- Compute Optimized
- Memory Optimized
- Accelerated Computing
- Storage Optimized
- High Performance Computing (HPC) Optimized

#### Pricing on EC2 instances
- **On-Demand**
  - Fixed pricing billed **by the second**
  - **Use when**:
    - Low cost, no upfront payments or commitments
    - Cannot interupt unpredictable workloads
    - Developing applications
    - Workload won't run longer than a year
  - **Capacity Reservation** hold capacity whether or not you run an instance
- **Spot Instances**
  - Take advantage of **unused** EC2 capacity
  - **Use when**:
    - Not concened with start or stop times
    - Can interupt workload
    - Very low compute prices are needed
    - **CHEAPEST OPTION**<br>Pay the price in effect at the beginning of the hour and save **up to 90%** off of On-Demand prices
- **Dedicated Hosts**
  - Pay for a **physical** server that is fully dedicated to running your instances
  - **Use when**:
    - Bring your own **server-bound software** license like Microsoft or Oracle
    - Regular or corporate **compliance requirements** around tenancy
    - Up to **70%** off On-Demand prices. **No sharing** your server with other customers.
- **Reserved Instances**
  - Commit to a **SPECIFIC** instance type for **1-3** years
  - **Use when**:
    - Steady state usage and can commit
    - Pay money upfront
    - Application requires a capacity reservation
  - Up to **72%** off of On-Demand prices with a **CONTRACT**. **Reserve capacity** in an AZ for any duration.<br>Pay all, partial or no upfront, but **All Upfront offers the highest discount**.
  - **Convert** instance type at **66%** discount.
- **Saving Plans**
  - Commit to **compute usage** for **1-3** years (measured per hour). Think Savings Plan if you need to lower your bill across multiple compute services, like EC2, Lambda, or Fargate.
  - **Use when**:
    - Lower your bill across multiple compute services
    - Flexibility to change compute services, instance type, operating systems or Regions.
  - **72%** off On-Demand prices.
  - Share savings **across compute services**
