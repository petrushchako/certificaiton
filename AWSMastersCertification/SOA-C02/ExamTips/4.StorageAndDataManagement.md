# Exam TIPS<br>**Storage and Data Management

## S3 101
- **Object-based**<br>Object-based allows you to upload files
- **Not OS or DB Storage**<br>Not suitable to install an operating system or run a database on
- **Files Up to 5 TB**<br>Files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
- **Unlimeted Storage**<br>The total volumes of data and the number of objects you can store is unlimited

<br>

- Files Stored in buckets
- S3 is a universal namespace and all names have to be globaly unique
- Sample bucket URL: `https://<bucket_name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<key_name>`

## S3 Storage Classes
|Storage Class|Availability andDurability|AZ|Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|
|**S3 Standard**|99.99% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|>=3|Suitable for most workloads (e.g., websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics)|
|**S3 Standard-Infrequent Access**|9.99% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|>=3|Long-term, infrequently accessed critical data (e.g., backups, data store for disaster recovery files, etc.). Minimum storage duration: 30|
|**S3 One Zone-Standard Access**|99.5% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|1|Long-term, infrequently accessed, non-critical data. Minimum storage duration: 30 days|
|**S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**|99.9% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|>=3|Long-lived data, accessed approximately once per quarter with millisecond retrieval time. Minimum storage duration: 90 days|
|**S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**|99.99% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|>=3|Long-term data archiving that occasionally needs to be accessed within a few hours or minutes. Retrieval options of 1 minute to 12 hours. Minimum storage duration: 90 days|
|**S3 Glacier Deep Archive**|99.99% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|>=3|Rarely accessed data archiving with default retrieval time of 12 hours (e.g., financial records for regulatory purposes). Minimum storage duration: 180 davs|

## S3 Lifecycle Policy
- **Cost Effective**<br>Ensure you are using the most cost-effective option to store your objects in S3.
- **Creation Date**<br>
Lifecycle rules are based on object creation date.
- **Transition**<br>
Transition your objects to Infrequently Accessed Storage or to Glacier based on the rules you configure.
- **Housekeeping**<br>
You can also set an expiry date for objects you want S3 to delete after a certain time period has elapsed.

## Creating an S3 Bucket
- S3 buckets and objects do not allow public access
- If we want to enable public access, we need to explicitly configure it (disable block public access on the bucket and configure bucket policy allowing annonymous read)
- Use S3 to store any file type you can think of, e.g. photos, videos, code, documents and text files
