# Exam TIPS<br>**Storage and Data Management

## S3 101
- **Object-based**<br>Object-based allows you to upload files
- **Not OS or DB Storage**<br>Not suitable to install an operating system or run a database on
- **Files Up to 5 TB**<br>Files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
- **Unlimeted Storage**<br>The total volumes of data and the number of objects you can store is unlimited

<br>

- Files Stored in buckets
- S3 is a universal namespace and all names have to be globaly unique
- Sample bucket URL: `https://<bucket_name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<key_name>`

## S3 Storage Classes
|Storage Class|Availability andDurability|AZ|Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|
|**S3 Standard**|99.99% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|>=3|Suitable for most workloads (e.g., websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics)|
|**S3 Standard-Infrequent Access**|9.99% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|>=3|Long-term, infrequently accessed critical data (e.g., backups, data store for disaster recovery files, etc.). Minimum storage duration: 30|
|**S3 One Zone-Standard Access**|99.5% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|1|Long-term, infrequently accessed, non-critical data. Minimum storage duration: 30 days|
|**S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**|99.9% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|>=3|Long-lived data, accessed approximately once per quarter with millisecond retrieval time. Minimum storage duration: 90 days|
|**S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**|99.99% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|>=3|Long-term data archiving that occasionally needs to be accessed within a few hours or minutes. Retrieval options of 1 minute to 12 hours. Minimum storage duration: 90 days|
|**S3 Glacier Deep Archive**|99.99% Availability<br>11 9's Durability|>=3|Rarely accessed data archiving with default retrieval time of 12 hours (e.g., financial records for regulatory purposes). Minimum storage duration: 180 davs|

## Working with S3 Lifecycle Policies
### What are S3 lifecycle policies?

A cost-effective way to store your files in S3.

- **Save Money**<br>Ensure your files are stored using the most cost-effective S3 option throughout their lifecycle
- **Lifecycle Rules**<br>Use lifecycle rules to tell S3 to transition objects to less expensive storage classes, archive them or delete them
- *Use Case*<br>Great for objects with a well-defined lifecycle, e.g. log files, which may not be useful once they reach a certain age

<br>

### Examples
- Transaction logs<br>Transition log files to an Infrequent Access stoage class 90 days after you create them
- Archive<br>Archive objects to Glacier, or Glacier Deep Archive 1 year after creating them
- Expiry Date<br>Configure objects to expire 1 year after creating them - S3 will auto-delete expired objects on your behalf
- Housekeeping<br>S3 buckets which have Server Access Loggins enabled can accumulate large log files over time. This is where you log all your requests to your S3 buckets. Once logs reach a certain age, you can set an expiry date and delete them for you.
