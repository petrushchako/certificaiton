# Exam TIPS<br>Security and Compliance

<br>

## Compliance on AWS
- Familiarize with compliance frameworks like **ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS**, and **FedRAMP**.
- Understand the **Shared Responsibility Model** and AWS GovCloud's role in federal compliance. The initiative which empowers the federal government to obtain objectives through innovation and cloud computing.
- Be aware of specific AWS tools (e.g., CloudTrail, CloudWatch) that assist in compliance tasks such as monitoring and auditing.

<br><br><br>

## Understanding Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- Key services to remember for DDoS mitigation:
  - **Amazon CloudFront, Route 53, CloudWatch, AWS WAF, AWS Shield, Elastic Load Balancing, AWS Auto Scaling**
- **Additional Resource**: Review the ![AWS DDoS White Paper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency.pdf) for in-depth strategies on mitigating DDoS attacks in AWS architectures.

<br><br><br>

## AWS Marketplace Security Products
- **Key Exam Tip**: Understand that purchasing a third-party security tool from AWS Marketplace can enhance the security of an AWS architecture.
- **Remember**: For questions about introducing additional security, consider AWS Marketplace as an option for sourcing third-party security solutions.

<br><br><br>

## IAM Refresh
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Understand IAM basics: users, groups, and roles, and how they grant access.
  - Recognize that IAM provides centralized control over an AWS account.
  - Be aware of IAM features like Identity Federation, MFA, temporary access, password policies, integration, and compliance.

<br><br><br>

## MFA
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA):**  
  - Adds a second layer of security for AWS accounts.  
  - Can be enabled for both root and IAM user accounts.  
  - Works with both the AWS console and CLI.  

- **Credential Report:**  
  - Lists all IAM users in the account.  
  - Includes details like password age, access key age, and MFA status.  
  - Useful for auditing and ensuring compliance with security best practices.  

<br><br><br>


## Introducing IAM Identity Center
- **Federated Identity:**  
  - Authentication across multiple systems using a single identity.  

- **IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO):**  
  - Centrally manages identity federation and SSO in AWS.  

- **Active Directory Integration:**  
  - **AD Connector:** Simplifies integration with on-premises AD.  
  - **AD Trust Relationship:** Configures trust between on-premises AD and AWS Directory Service.  

<br><br><br>


## Auditing and Troubleshooting Access Issues
- **CloudTrail:**  
  - Logs API activity and stores events in S3 or CloudWatch Logs.  
  - Use with Athena for advanced querying.  

- **IAM Access Analyzer:**  
  - Identifies externally shared resources.  
  - Key services include S3, Lambda, IAM roles, and Secrets Manager.  

- **IAM Policy Simulator:**  
  - Simulates and troubleshoots IAM policies for users, groups, and roles.  
  - Test conditions like IP restrictions, dates, and actions before applying.  

<br><br><br>


## AWS Inspector vs Advisor
- **AWS Inspector**: Think **EC2 security** and network vulnerabilities.  
- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Broad **optimization recommendations** across **many AWS services**.  
  - **Security checks**: Public snapshots, S3 permissions, MFA on root, etc.  
  - **Cost-saving tips**: Idle resources or optimization opportunities.  
  - **Fault tolerance**: Multi-AZ, backups, health checks.
