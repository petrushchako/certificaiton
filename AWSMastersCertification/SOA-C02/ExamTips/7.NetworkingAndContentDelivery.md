# Exam TIPS<br>Networking and Content Delivery

## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Overview
- Think of a VPC as a logical data center in AWS
- Consists of subnets, route tables, network access controll lists, security groups and internet gateways (or virtual private gateways)
- 1 subnet is always in 1 Availability Zone

<br><br><br>



## Understanding VPC Peering
- By default resources in one VPC cannot communicate with reources in another VPC
- Inter-VPC communication (peering) enables EC2 instances in one VPC to communicate with instance in another using private IP addresses
- Can be cross-account and cross-region. The VPC do not heed to be in the same account or AWS Region

<br><br><br>



## Securely Connecting to a VPC Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
1. **Purpose**:
   - A VPN provides a **secure, encrypted connection** between:
     - On-premises networks.
     - Remote offices.
     - Client devices.
     - AWS resources.

2. **Components**:
   - **Virtual Private Gateway**: Configured in your AWS VPC.
   - **Customer Gateway**: Configured in your on-premises network.
   - These two gateways work together to establish a secure tunnel.

3. **Security**:
   - **Encryption**: Network packets passing through the tunnel are encrypted.
   - **Cryptographic Processing**: Handled by both the virtual private gateway and the customer gateway.

4. **Device Compatibility**:
   - Use a device that supports **IPsec**.
   - Vendors include Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Juniper, and others.

### **Conclusion**
- Site-to-site VPNs enable **secure communication** between corporate data centers and AWS VPCs.
- Critical for exam preparation to understand configuration, components, and security principles.
- Questions? Feel free to ask!

## What is Direct Connect
- **Purpose**:
  - Direct Connect enables **private, dedicated communication** between your data center and AWS VPC.
- **Benefits**:
  - **High throughput**: Handles large volumes of network traffic.
  - **Configurable speeds**: Choose from 1, 10, or 100 Gbps.
  - **Consistency**: Reliable and predictable performance.
  - **Security**: Provides a secure and private connection.
- **Key Use Case**:
  - Alternative to site-to-site VPNs when reliability and performance are critical.

### **Summary**
- Direct Connect offers **secure, consistent, and high-speed connectivity** between your data center and AWS.
- It’s particularly suitable for organizations with **large workloads** and the need for **stable network connections**.
- For exams, focus on:
  - **What Direct Connect does**.
  - **Why it’s beneficial compared to VPNs**.

## Understanding VPC Flow Logs
- **Purpose**: VPC flow logs log IP traffic to and from your VPC or network interfaces.  
- **Traffic Types**: Can record accepted, rejected, or all traffic.  
- **Storage**: Flow logs can be stored in CloudWatch or S3.  
- **Use Cases**: Best for troubleshooting network connectivity issues and analyzing traffic flows.  

<br><br><br>



## Introducing Domain Name Service (DNS)
- DNS converts **domain names** into **IP addresses**.  
- The **last word in a domain name** is the **top-level domain** (e.g., `.com`, `.edu`).  
- Domains are managed through **domain registrars** like GoDaddy or AWS.  
- DNS knowledge is foundational for understanding AWS Route 53.  


<br><br><br>



## Introducing Route 53
- **DNS Records**:  
  - **SOA Record**: Basic domain information, including admin email.  
  - **NS Record**: Identifies authoritative name servers for a domain.  
  - **A Record**: Maps domain names to IPv4 addresses.  
  - **Alias Record**: Preferred for mapping AWS resources; supports zone apex.  
  - **CNAME Record**: Used for mapping one domain name to another; cannot be used for zone apex.  

- **Key Alias vs. CNAME Differences**:  
  - Alias supports zone apex and is AWS-specific.  
  - CNAME cannot be used for zone apex and incurs charges.  

- **TTL Settings**:  
  - Use shorter TTLs for frequent DNS updates and longer TTLs to reduce costs.  

<br><br><br>



## Exploring Route 53 Resolver
- **Primary Use**: Resolves DNS queries for:  
  - Resources **inside the VPC** (e.g., EC2 instances, ELB, private hosted zones).  
  - External domains **outside the VPC** via recursive lookups to public name servers.  
- **Integration**:  
  - Can integrate with DNS resolvers on:  
    - Peered VPCs.  
    - On-premises networks.  
    - Any network reachable from the VPC.  

<br><br><br>



## Understanding Route 53 Routing Policies

- **Simple Routing Policy**: Routes to a single resource.  
- **Failover Routing Policy**: For active-passive setups; primary fails, traffic goes to backup.  
- **Geolocation Routing Policy**: Based on the user's location.  
- **Geoproximity Routing Policy**: Based on distance to AWS resources; allows bias configuration.  
- **Latency-Based Routing Policy**: Routes to the region with the best performance (lowest latency).  
- **Multivalue Answer Routing Policy**: Returns multiple healthy records (up to 8) at random.  
- **Weighted Routing Policy**: Divides traffic across resources based on defined weights.  

<br><br><br>



## Understanding Route 53 Failover Alias Records
- **Alias Record**:  
  - Routes traffic to AWS resources like CloudFront, S3, or ELB.  

- **Failover Alias Record**:  
  - Configures two resources:  
    - **Primary** (active resource, e.g., ELB).  
    - **Secondary** (backup resource, e.g., S3 static website).  

- **Use Case**:  
  - Switch traffic to an S3 static website if the primary EC2 website fails.  

<br><br><br>


## Overview of CloudFront
1. **Edge Locations**:  
   - Separate from AWS Regions or Availability Zones.  
   - Store cached content closer to users.  

2. **Origin**:  
   - Can be an S3 bucket, EC2 instance, ELB, Route 53, or external server.  

3. **TTL (Time to Live)**:  
   - Objects are cached for a defined TTL period.  
   - Cache clearing before TTL expiration incurs charges.  

4. **Use Case**:  
   - Consistently improves performance for users worldwide by reducing latency.  

<br><br><br>


## Identifying CloudFront Caching Errors
1. **400 Errors**:  
   - **Client-side issue**.  
   - Remember: **403 = Access Denied**, **404 = Object Not Found**.  

2. **500 Errors**:  
   - **Server-side issue**.  
   - **Memory Aid**: The number **5** resembles an **S**, standing for **Server-side**.  
   - Think of capacity, performance, and high traffic as potential causes.  

3. **General Exam Advice**:  
   - Identify if the issue is **client-side** or **server-side** based on context.  
   - Use **elimination** to narrow down answers.  

<br><br><br>


## CloudFront Cache Hit Ratio 
1. **Definition**: Cache hit ratio measures the proportion of requests served from the CloudFront cache.  
2. **Impact of TTL**:  
   - Increasing TTL improves the cache hit ratio.  
   - Decreasing TTL ensures users see updated content.  
3. **Max TTL**: The maximum value is **1 year**.  
4. **Balancing Act**: Adjust TTL based on content update frequency and performance needs.  

<br><br><br>


## Advanced CloudFront
1. **Forwarding Cookies**:  
   - Use **Origin Request Policy** to serve different content versions based on cookie values.  
2. **Forwarding Headers**:  
   - Configure **Origin Request Policy** to forward HTTP headers and serve customized content.  
3. **Custom Domain Names**:  
   - **Route 53 Alias Record**: Simplest method.  
   - **Alternate Domain Name in CloudFront**: Requires a **custom SSL certificate** for validation.
