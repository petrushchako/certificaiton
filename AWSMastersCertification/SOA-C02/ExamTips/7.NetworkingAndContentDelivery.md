## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Overview
- Think of a VPC as a logical data center in AWS
- Consists of subnets, route tables, network access controll lists, security groups and internet gateways (or virtual private gateways)
- 1 subnet is always in 1 Availability Zone

<br><br><br>

## Understanding VPC Peering
- By default resources in one VPC cannot communicate with reources in another VPC
- Inter-VPC communication (peering) enables EC2 instances in one VPC to communicate with instance in another using private IP addresses
- Can be cross-account and cross-region. The VPC do not heed to be in the same account or AWS Region

## Securely Connecting to a VPC Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
1. **Purpose**:
   - A VPN provides a **secure, encrypted connection** between:
     - On-premises networks.
     - Remote offices.
     - Client devices.
     - AWS resources.

2. **Components**:
   - **Virtual Private Gateway**: Configured in your AWS VPC.
   - **Customer Gateway**: Configured in your on-premises network.
   - These two gateways work together to establish a secure tunnel.

3. **Security**:
   - **Encryption**: Network packets passing through the tunnel are encrypted.
   - **Cryptographic Processing**: Handled by both the virtual private gateway and the customer gateway.

4. **Device Compatibility**:
   - Use a device that supports **IPsec**.
   - Vendors include Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Juniper, and others.

### **Conclusion**
- Site-to-site VPNs enable **secure communication** between corporate data centers and AWS VPCs.
- Critical for exam preparation to understand configuration, components, and security principles.
- Questions? Feel free to ask!

## What is Direct Connect
- **Purpose**:
  - Direct Connect enables **private, dedicated communication** between your data center and AWS VPC.
- **Benefits**:
  - **High throughput**: Handles large volumes of network traffic.
  - **Configurable speeds**: Choose from 1, 10, or 100 Gbps.
  - **Consistency**: Reliable and predictable performance.
  - **Security**: Provides a secure and private connection.
- **Key Use Case**:
  - Alternative to site-to-site VPNs when reliability and performance are critical.

#### **Summary**
- Direct Connect offers **secure, consistent, and high-speed connectivity** between your data center and AWS.
- It’s particularly suitable for organizations with **large workloads** and the need for **stable network connections**.
- For exams, focus on:
  - **What Direct Connect does**.
  - **Why it’s beneficial compared to VPNs**.

## Understanding VPC Flow Logs
- **Purpose**: VPC flow logs log IP traffic to and from your VPC or network interfaces.  
- **Traffic Types**: Can record accepted, rejected, or all traffic.  
- **Storage**: Flow logs can be stored in CloudWatch or S3.  
- **Use Cases**: Best for troubleshooting network connectivity issues and analyzing traffic flows.

## Introducing Domain Name Service (DNS)

- DNS converts **domain names** into **IP addresses**.  
- The **last word in a domain name** is the **top-level domain** (e.g., `.com`, `.edu`).  
- Domains are managed through **domain registrars** like GoDaddy or AWS.  
- DNS knowledge is foundational for understanding AWS Route 53.  


<br><br><br>


## Introducing Route 53
- **DNS Records**:  
  - **SOA Record**: Basic domain information, including admin email.  
  - **NS Record**: Identifies authoritative name servers for a domain.  
  - **A Record**: Maps domain names to IPv4 addresses.  
  - **Alias Record**: Preferred for mapping AWS resources; supports zone apex.  
  - **CNAME Record**: Used for mapping one domain name to another; cannot be used for zone apex.  

- **Key Alias vs. CNAME Differences**:  
  - Alias supports zone apex and is AWS-specific.  
  - CNAME cannot be used for zone apex and incurs charges.  

- **TTL Settings**:  
  - Use shorter TTLs for frequent DNS updates and longer TTLs to reduce costs.
