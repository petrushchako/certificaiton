## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Overview
- Think of a VPC as a logical data center in AWS
- Consists of subnets, route tables, network access controll lists, security groups and internet gateways (or virtual private gateways)
- 1 subnet is always in 1 Availability Zone

## Understanding VPC Peering
- By default resources in one VPC cannot communicate with reources in another VPC
- Inter-VPC communication (peering) enables EC2 instances in one VPC to communicate with instance in another using private IP addresses
- Can be cross-account and cross-region. The VPC do not heed to be in the same account or AWS Region

## Securely Connecting to a VPC Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
1. **Purpose**:
   - A VPN provides a **secure, encrypted connection** between:
     - On-premises networks.
     - Remote offices.
     - Client devices.
     - AWS resources.

2. **Components**:
   - **Virtual Private Gateway**: Configured in your AWS VPC.
   - **Customer Gateway**: Configured in your on-premises network.
   - These two gateways work together to establish a secure tunnel.

3. **Security**:
   - **Encryption**: Network packets passing through the tunnel are encrypted.
   - **Cryptographic Processing**: Handled by both the virtual private gateway and the customer gateway.

4. **Device Compatibility**:
   - Use a device that supports **IPsec**.
   - Vendors include Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Juniper, and others.

### **Conclusion**
- Site-to-site VPNs enable **secure communication** between corporate data centers and AWS VPCs.
- Critical for exam preparation to understand configuration, components, and security principles.
- Questions? Feel free to ask!
