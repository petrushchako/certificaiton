## CloudWatch

- **CloudWatch** is all about monitoring the performance adn health of your systems.
- **Default host-level metrics**:
  - CPU
  - Network
  - Disk
  - Status check
  
    > Any other metric outside following list will require installation of `CloudWatch Agent`
- Use the **CloudWatch agent** for operating system-level metrics:
  - Memory usage
  - Processes
  - CPU idle time


## CloudWatch Dashboard
- **A CUSTOM VIEW**<br>Create a dashboard which monitors the metrics that are meaningful to you, e.g. all your production systems.
- **MULTI-REGION**<br>Display metrics for any region. Change the region and add the widget you want.
- **REMEMBER TO SAVE**<br>CloudWatch doesn't automatically save your dashboard, so remember to save it once you have configured it.
