# Exam TIPS<br>Monitoring, Logging and Remediation

<br>

## CloudWatch

- **CloudWatch** is all about monitoring the performance adn health of your systems.
- **Default host-level metrics**:
  - CPU
  - Network
  - Disk
  - Status check
  
    > Any other metric outside following list will require installation of `CloudWatch Agent`
- Use the **CloudWatch agent** for operating system-level metrics:
  - Memory usage
  - Processes
  - CPU idle time


## CloudWatch Dashboard
- **A CUSTOM VIEW**<br>Create a dashboard which monitors the metrics that are meaningful to you, e.g. all your production systems.
- **MULTI-REGION**<br>Display metrics for any region. Change the region and add the widget you want.
- **REMEMBER TO SAVE**<br>CloudWatch doesn't automatically save your dashboard, so remember to save it once you have configured it.

## CloudWatch Logs

1. **Log Events:**
   - Consist of an event message and a timestamp.
   - Example: Log events coming from an Apache log.

2. **Log Stream:**
   - A sequence of log events from the same source.
   - Example: An Apache log coming from a specific EC2 instance.

3. **Log Group:**
   - A collection of log streams.
   - Log groups allow centralized management of retention, monitoring, and access control settings.
   - Example: Multiple web servers running Apache and sending log events into CloudWatch can be managed as a single log group.

4. **Retention Settings:**
   - CloudWatch Logs are kept indefinitely by default but can be customized between 1 day and 10 years.
   - Retention settings are applied at the log group level.
