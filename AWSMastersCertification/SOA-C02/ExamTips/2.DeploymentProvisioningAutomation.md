# Exam TIPS<br>Deployment Provisioning Automation

## EBS
- **Elastic Block Store: SSD volumes**
  - High available and scalable storage volumes you can attach to an EC2 instance

    | Feature| General Purpose SSD Volumes (gp3)| General Purpose SSD Volumes (gp2)| Provisioned IOPS SSD Volumes (io2 Block Express)| Provisioned IOPS SSD Volumes (io1)|
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | **Durability**| 99.8% - 99.9% durability (0.1% - 0.2% annual failure rate) | 99.8% - 99.9% durability (0.1% - 0.2% annual failure rate) | 99.999% durability (0.001% annual failure rate) | 99.8% - 99.9% durability (0.1% - 0.2% annual failure rate) |
    | **Use Cases**|- Transactional workloads<br>- Virtual desktops<br>- Medium-sized, single-instance databases<br>- Low-latency interactive applications<br>- Boot volumes<br>- Development and test environments| - Transactional workloads<br>- Virtual desktops<br>- Medium-sized, single-instance databases<br>- Low-latency interactive applications<br>- Boot volumes<br>- Development and test environments| Workloads that require:<br>- Sub-millisecond latency<br>- Sustained IOPS performance<br>- More than 64,000 IOPS or 1,000 MiB/s of throughput| - Workloads that require sustained IOPS performance or more than 16,000 IOPS<br>- I/O-intensive database workloads|
    | **Volume Size**| 1 GiB - 16 TiB| 1 GiB - 16 TiB| 4 GiB - 64 TiB| 4 GiB - 16 TiB|
    | **Max IOPS per Volume**| 16,000 (64 KiB I/O)| 16,000 (16 KiB I/O)| 256,000 (16 KiB I/O)| 64,000 (16 KiB I/O)|

    - `io2 Block Express` **Provisioned IOPS SSD**
      - For the largest, most critical, high- performance applications: SAP HANA, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM DB2.
      - Up to 64 TB, 256,000 lOPS per volume.
      - 99.999% durability.

- **Elastic Block Store - HDD Volumes**
    - Highly available and scalable storage volumes you can attach to an EC2 instance.

    | Feature| Throughput Optimized HDD Volumes (st1)| Cold HDD Volumes (sc1)|
    |---|---|---|
    | **Durability**| 99.8% - 99.9% durability (0.1% - 0.2% annual failure rate) | 99.8% - 99.9% durability (0.1% - 0.2% annual failure rate) |
    | **Use Cases**| - Big data<br>- Data warehouses<br>- Log processing| - Throughput-oriented storage for data that is infrequently accessed<br>- Scenarios where the lowest storage cost is important|
    | **Volume Size**| 125 GiB - 16 TiB| 125 GiB - 16 TiB|
    | **Max IOPS per Volume (1 MiB I/O)** | 500| 250|
    | **Max Throughput per Volume**| 500 MiB/s| 250 MiB/s|
    | **Amazon EBS Multi-Attach**| Not supported| Not supported|
    | **Boot Volume**| Not supported| Not supported|

## Bastion Host
1. **Connect to Private Instances**
    A bastion host enables you to connect to private instances in your VPC from an untrusted network using SSH or RDP.
2. **Public Subnet**
    A bastion is in a public subnet and is reachable from the internet.
3. **Security Groups**
    You need to configure the security group associated with the **private subnet** to enable SSH / RDP access from the bastion.

## Elastic Load Balancer
- **Aplication Load Balancer**
  - HTTP/S
  - Inteligent load balancing
  - Routes request to a specific web server based on the type of request
- **Network Load Balancer**
  - Provides high-performance load balancing for TCP traffic
- **Classic Load Balancer**
  - The legacy option that supports both HTTP/S and TCP
  - May still appear in the exam
- **Gateway Load Balancer**
  - Provides load balancing for third-party virtual applicances, like firewalls, Intrusion detection and prevention systems
- **X0Forwarded-For**
  - If you need the IPv4 address of your end user, look for the `X-Forwarded-For` header

## Sticky Session
- Sticky seesions override the algorithm default behaviour
- Use cookies to identify a session, and send request that are part of the same session to the same target.
- Use for applications that cache session information locally on the web server.
- Consider shopping carts, online forms, a training website - we don't want to log out our customers halfway through a task.
