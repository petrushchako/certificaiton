# Exam TIPS<br>Cost and Performance Optimization


<br>

## AWS Cost Explorer and Cost Allocation Tags
1. **Tags**:
   - Tags are **key-value pairs** used to organize and track AWS resources.
   - Using tags is a best practice.
2. **Cost Allocation Tags**:
   - Must be **enabled** in the AWS Console.
   - Enable both **user-defined** and **AWS-generated** tags for full tracking.
3. **Cost Explorer**:
   - Allows visualization, analysis, and filtering of AWS usage costs.
   - Supports creating **cost, usage, savings plans, and reservation** reports.

## Improving Costs with AWS Budgets
1. **Budget Types**: AWS Budgets allows tracking of cost, usage, savings plans, and reservations.  
2. **Alerting**: Alerts are configurable for thresholds and sent via email or SNS.  
3. **Master Account**: Budgets must be configured in the **master account** to track linked accounts.

## Reducing Cost through Managed Services
1. **Understand Managed Services**:  
   - AWS manages infrastructure and updates.  
   - Benefits: Elasticity, scalability, and reduced operational costs.  

2. **Know Service Features**:  
   - **Fargate**: Pay-as-you-go for containers, no server management.  
   - **EFS**: Automatic storage scaling, multiple storage classes, lifecycle policies.  
   - **RDS**: Aurora Serverless, storage auto-scaling, Reserved Instances.  

3. **Cost-Reduction Goals**:  
   - Improved performance.  
   - Reduced support and operational costs.

## AWS Compute Optimizer
1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Machine learning-based recommendations for cost and performance optimization.
   - Focused on EC2, Auto Scaling groups, EBS, and Lambda.
2. **Export Options**:
   - Recommendations exportable in **CSV** or **JSON** to **S3**.
3. **Cross-Service Integration**:
   - Works with **S3**, **Cost Explorer**, and **Systems Manager**.

<br><br><br>


## Using Metrics to Improve Performance and Costs
1. **CloudWatch Metrics**:
   - Monitor performance and cost for AWS services and custom applications.
   - Automatically generated for AWS resources; supports custom metrics.
   
2. **Metrics Explorer**:
   - Filter, aggregate, and graph metrics.
   - Use tagging for resource-specific analysis.
   - Add graphs to dashboards for centralized monitoring.

3. **Metric Streams**:
   - Stream metrics to S3 for storage or Kinesis Firehose for real-time analysis.
   - Useful for integrating CloudWatch metrics with other AWS or third-party tools.

## Increasing S3 Transfer Speeds with Transfer Acceleration
1. **Purpose**:
   - Enables **fast, secure, and reliable long-distance transfers** to S3 using CloudFront Edge locations.
2. **Use Cases**:
   - Applications or users located far from the S3 bucket.
   - Large-scale data uploads and downloads requiring minimal latency.
3. **Performance**:
   - Can improve transfer speeds by **50-500%** compared to standard S3 transfers.
4. **Configuration**:
   - Requires enabling Transfer Acceleration for the bucket and using the special URL format.
5. **Routing**:
   - Data travels through AWS's backbone network instead of the public internet.
