# Exam TIPS<br>Reliability and Business Continuity

## Elasticity and scalability
- **Elasticity**<br>Scale with demand (short term)
- **Scalability**<br>Scale out infrastructure (long term)

<br><br><br>

## AWS Auto Scaling
1. **Scaling plans**<br>A set of directions for scaling your resources
2. **Dynamic Scaling** uses trashold to trigger action
3. **Predictive Scaling** uses forecating and machine learning to re-allocate resources.

Demo:
- **Auto Scaling Groups**<br>Automatically scale EC2 instances through the EC2 service
- **Auto Scale Scaling Plans** Scale EC2, ECS, DynamoDB, and Aurora through tagging, CloudFormation, and Auto Scaling Groups within the AWS Auto Scaling service

## Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling
- **Vertical Scaling**
  - Think of the analogy of a "bigger house." This approach means upgrading machine capacity by increasing **disk, storage, CPU, or memory**.
- **Horizontal Scaling**
  - Remember the “two houses” analogy. This approach involves **adding instances or nodes** to balance the load across infrastructure. This configuration typically includes **load balancers**, **Auto Scaling groups**, and **multi-availability zones** for enhanced resilience and distribution.
