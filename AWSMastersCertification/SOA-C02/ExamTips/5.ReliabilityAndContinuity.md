# Exam TIPS<br>Reliability and Business Continuity

## Elasticity and scalability
- **Elasticity**<br>Scale with demand (short term)
- **Scalability**<br>Scale out infrastructure (long term)

<br><br><br>

## AWS Auto Scaling
1. **Scaling plans**<br>A set of directions for scaling your resources
2. **Dynamic Scaling** uses trashold to trigger action
3. **Predictive Scaling** uses forecating and machine learning to re-allocate resources.

Demo:
- **Auto Scaling Groups**<br>Automatically scale EC2 instances through the EC2 service
- **Auto Scale Scaling Plans** Scale EC2, ECS, DynamoDB, and Aurora through tagging, CloudFormation, and Auto Scaling Groups within the AWS Auto Scaling service

## Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling
- **Vertical Scaling**
  - Think of the analogy of a "bigger house." This approach means upgrading machine capacity by increasing **disk, storage, CPU, or memory**.
- **Horizontal Scaling**
  - Remember the “two houses” analogy. This approach involves **adding instances or nodes** to balance the load across infrastructure. This configuration typically includes **load balancers**, **Auto Scaling groups**, and **multi-availability zones** for enhanced resilience and distribution.

<br><br><br>

## ElastiCache
 - **Caching for Database Load**: Use ElastiCache for read-heavy databases under high stress but with infrequent changes.
 - **Monitoring Metrics**: Keep track of **CPU utilization, swap usage, evictions**, and **concurrent connections** for effective ElastiCache maintenance.
 - **Alternative Services**: Use Redshift for applications experiencing heavy Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) transactions rather than cache-intensive operations.


<br><br><br>

## Aurora
 - **Aurora Types**: Know the difference between `Aurora (standard)` and `Aurora Serverless`.
 - **Redundancy**: Aurora maintains two copies of data across three Availability Zones, totaling six copies for redundancy.
 - **Self-Healing**: Aurora’s storage scans data blocks for errors and automatically repairs them.
 - **Scaling for Utilization**:
    - **Write Scaling**: If Aurora is 100% utilized for writes, scale up by increasing the instance size.
    - **Read Scaling**: If read utilization is high, scale out by adding read replicas.
 - **Cluster Volume Knowledge**: Be familiar with the Aurora database cluster and cluster volume functionalities for exam readiness.


<br>

## Understanding Aurora Auto Scaling Options
 - **Adjusts only replicas** (not the primary instance).
 - Uses **target tracking scaling** with average CPU utilization or connection count.
 - Allows users to specify desired values (e.g., 80% CPU utilization or 5,000 connections).
 - Scales based on **workload changes**, adding or removing replicas as needed.

<br>

## RDS and Multi-AZ Failover
- **Multi-AZ Failover is Not a Scaling Solution**: It is designed for **disaster recovery**, not for horizontal scaling.
- **Forcing Failover**: You can manually trigger failover by **rebooting the instance** via the AWS Management Console or by using the `RebootDBInstance` API through AWS CLI.
- **AWS-Managed Failover**: AWS automatically handles DNS updates to redirect traffic to a healthy standby instance during failover.
- **Read Replicas for Scaling**: Use read replicas for scaling read-heavy workloads, as Multi-AZ won’t impact performance.

<br>

## RDS and Read Replicas
- **Read Replica Limits**: Up to 5 read replicas per instance for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MariaDB.
- **Cross-Region Replication**: All engines support read replicas in different regions.
- **Asynchronous Replication**: Replication is asynchronous, not synchronous.
- **Multi-AZ Support**: Read replicas can be built from Multi-AZ databases and can be Multi-AZ themselves.
- **Read Replica Chains**: Read replicas of read replicas are allowed but may introduce latency.
- **Backups**: Automated backups and snapshots cannot be taken from read replicas.
- **Replica Lag**: Key metric to monitor.
- **Read Replicas vs. Multi-AZ**:
  - **Read Replicas**: Primarily for increasing **read capacity** and handling maintenance/read-heavy tasks.
  - **Multi-AZ**: Primarily for **disaster recovery** to provide high availability.
