![](../img/demo/2.5.EC2-ImageBuilder.png)

1. Create an lAM Role
- In the AWS console search for `IAM`
- On the left-side manu select `Access management/Roles`
- `Create role`
- Trusted entity type: `AWS service`
- Use case: `EC2`
- `Next`
- Search and select following policies:
  - [x] `EC2InstanceProfileForImageBuilder`
  - [x] `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
- `Next` to `Role details` configuration screen
- Role name: `MyImageBuilderRole`
- Review configuration and select `Create role`


2. Create an Image Pipeline
- Search for `Image Builder` in console.
- Select `Create image pipeline`
- In `General`:
  - Pipeline name: `My Image Pipeline`
  - Diselect `Enable enhanced metadata collection`<br>This option uses System Manager Inventory, and requires additional configuration.
  - Optionally you can enable **Security scanning**, that internally utilizes Amazon Inspector to naalyze build image.
  - Build schedule: `Manual`
  - At the bottom of the page select `Next`
- In `Choose recipe`:
  - Recipe: `Create new recipe`
  - Image type: `Amazone Machine Image (AMI)`
  - General:Name: `My recipe`
  - Version: `1.0.0`
  - Base Image: `Select managed images`
  - Image Operation System (OS): `Amazon Linux`
  - Image origin: `Quick start (Amazon-managed)`
  - Image name: `Amazon Linux 2023 x86`
  - Auto-version options: `Use latest available OS version`
  - Move on to Instance configuration
  - In SSM agent section, tick the box `Remove SSM agent after pipeline execution`
  - Working Directory: `/tmp`
- **Step 1: Components** section lets you to select apps or scripts that will modify your image.
  - In this demo, we want to select latest security update:
    - In `Build component - Amazon Linux` search for `update`, and select `update-linux` option
- **Step 2: Optional Select tests to verify the output AMI (post-build)**
  - Search and select `simple-boot-test-linux`
- Leave storage and tag configuration on default.
- In `Define infrastructure configuration - optional` section, if you stick with default configuration, Image Builder will use large EC2 instances. Bigger instances take long to configure, as well as cost more money.
  - Select `Create a new infrastructure configuration`
  - In General:
    - Name: `My Configuration`
    - IAM role: `<previously create IAM role>`
  - In AWS Infrastructure:
    - Instance type: `t3.micro`
    - Optionally, you can configure `SNS` topic to receive notifications.
    - Leave everything else on default.
- **Step 4: Define distribution settings**
  - By default image will be distributed to the same region you are currently operating in. But you can modiy the default behaviour in this section.
  - In this lab we will stick with default:
    - [x] Create distribution settings using service defaults
    - [ ] Use existing distribution settings
    - [ ] Create new distribution settings
- **Step 5: Review** review configuration and select to `Create pipeline` to finalize the setup.



3. Execute the Pipeline
- After successfully creating pipeline, tag the box next to it.
- Expand `Actions` dropdown and choose `Run pipeline`
  - [x] Run pipeline
  - [ ] Disable pipeline
  - [ ] Delete pipeline
- On the top rith, you can select `View details` to see the status.
- It take approximatelly 20 minutes to create an image.
- In `EC2` instances, you can find the image which Image Builder uses as runtime environment (one for build and another one for test).
- You can track the status of the pipeline from `EC2 Image Builder/Image pipelines` section. Select your pipeline and switch to `Output Images`, where status for specific image build version will be shown. (i.e. Building/Testing/Distributing/Available)
