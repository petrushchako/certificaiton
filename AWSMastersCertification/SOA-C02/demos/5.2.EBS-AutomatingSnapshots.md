# Demo:<br>Automating EBS Snapshots Using Data Lifecycle Manager

![](../img/demo/5.2.EBS-Snapshot-Automation.png)

### Objectives
1. Launch an EC2 isntance with an attached EBS volume
2. Create a lifecycle policy within Data Lifecycle Manager
3. Enable cross-region replication for our EBS snapshot

<br>

## Solution
1. Launch an EC2 isntance with an attached EBS volume
    - Launch EC2 instance with following parameters:
      - Name: `DLM Test`
      - OS: `Amazon Linux`
      - Type: `t3.micro`
      - Keyapir: `No`
      - Storage: `Add new volume` (EBS, 10GB, gp3)
      - `Launch instance`
    - Wait for EC2 state to run to `Running`
  > **Note**:<br>When creating lifecycle polity you have to identify resources with tags
    - Add tag to a volume:
      - Navigate to `Volumes` in EC2 side menu
      - Find your EBS volume and hover over the name so the pencil appears. Press on the pencil and enter the name for your volume (e.g. `EBS-Automation-Snapshot-Enabled`)

2. Create a lifecycle policy within Data Lifecycle Manager



3. Enable cross-region replication for our EBS snapshot
