### Objective
1. **Create an AWS Config Rule**<br>Our rule will check that all EC2 instances are created without public IP address
2. **Create an SNS Topic**<br>We'll subscribe to the topic using our email address
3. **Configure an EventBridge Rule**<br>Our EventBridge rule will trigger an SNS notification whenever a `Config rule compliance change` event is detected
4. **Test Our Setup**<br>Create an EC2 instance with a public IP address and see if we receive a notification
