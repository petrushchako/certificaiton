![](../img/demo/3.8.AWSConfig-AutomaticRemediation.png)

<br>

### Lesson Objectives
1. **Launch Two EC2 Instances**<br>One will be Amazon Linux and the other will be RedHat
2. **Create IAM Role and Trust Policy**
3. **Create an AWS Config Rule**<br>Create a rule in AWS Config which checks that all EC2 instances are running Amazon Linux
4. **After the Rule Is Evaluated**<br>Config should report that we have one instance that is compliant and one that is non-compliant
5. **Config Automatic Remediation**<br>Configure AWS Config to automatically stop the non-compliant instances (under the hood, it is using AWS Systems Manager)

<br>

### Lesson Prerequisite

#### Prerequisite: **An IAM role is required**

> Will be configured using a script<br>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/course-aws-sysops-administrator-associate/main/Automation_With_AWS_Config_Demo/roleconfig.sh
- **Name**: `MyAutomationRole`
- **Managed policy**: `AmazonSSMAutomationRole`<br>This contains the permissions required to stop an EC2 instance
- **Inline policy**: Allows this role to be passed to another service
- **Trust policy**: `Allows Systems Manager and EC2 to assume the role`.<br>This enables EC2 to register the Systems Manager, and Systems Manager to stop the EC2 instance.

<br>


## Solution
1. **Launch Two EC2 Instances**
    - In `EC2` create 2 instances (with dofference being two different OS platforms):
      - Amazon Linux 2
      - Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    - Type: `t3.micro`
    - Proceed without a key pair

    > **AMI ID**<br>
    > Take a note of Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID. It will be used later during setup of AWS Config Rule<br><br>

2. Create IAM Role and Trust Policy
    - Use the script provided below to create a role:
        ```sh
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Creating our IAM Role 'MyAutomationRole', required for AWS Config auto remediation"
        echo "Attaching the the AmazonSSMAutomationRole AWS Managed Policy..."
        #This command creates our role and configures a trust policy which allows EC2 and Systems Manager to assume the role.
        echo "Creating the role and configuring the Trust Policy, to allow EC2 and Systems Manager to assume this role..."
        iamRoleArn=$(aws iam create-role --role-name "MyAutomationRole" \
        --assume-role-policy-document '{
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Service": [
                            "ec2.amazonaws.com",
                            "ssm.amazonaws.com"
                        ]
                    },
                    "Action": [
                        "sts:AssumeRole"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }' --query "Role.Arn" --output=text)

        #This command attaches the AmazonSSMAutomationRole AWS Managed Policy 
        echo "Attaching the the AmazonSSMAutomationRole AWS Managed Policy..."
        aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name "MyAutomationRole" \
        --policy-arn "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonSSMAutomationRole"

        #This command adds the inline policy which allows the role to be passed to another service. We have to pass in the ARN of our role. 
        echo "Adding the inline policy which allows the role to be passed to another service..."
        aws iam put-role-policy --role-name "MyAutomationRole" \
        --policy-name "AllowPassRole" \
        --policy-document '{
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
                    "Resource": "'$iamRoleArn'"
                }
            ]
        }'
        #Finally, we'll output the ARN of the role we created
        echo $iamRoleArn
        ```


    > **Script execution**<br>
    > The easiest way to execute script above, it ro run in AWS Cloud Shell

    - Execution: 
      - Copy script to a file:
        `curl -o roleconfig.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/course-aws-sysops-administrator-associate/main/Automation_With_AWS_Config_Demo/roleconfig.sh`
      - Change permission:
            `chmod u+x roleconfig.sh`
      - Run the script:
            `./roleconfig.sh`

          > **Success message**
          >
          > If everything was successful, the ARN of the role will be printer to stdout

3. **Create an AWS Config Rule** 
    - In `Config` navigate to `Rules`
    - Select `Add rule` and provide following details:
      - **Step 1**
      - Select rule type: `Add AWS managed rule`
      - In **AWS Managed Rules** search for and select: `approved-amis-by-id`
      - `Next`<br><br>
      - **Step 2**
      - Scope of changes: `Resources`
      - Resource cathegories: `AWS EC2 Instance`
      - Parameters: `<Insert ami id copied from AMI2 EC2 instance>` (i.e. ami-Ob5eea76982371e91)
      - `Next` review and create by pressing `Add rule`


4. **After the Rule Is Evaluated**
    - Since the resource was already created, you need to manually trigger the evaluation by following steps below:
        - In `Config`>`Rules` select (radio button) the rule you previously created
        - Navigate to `Actions` and select `Re-evaluate`
        - ![](../img/demo/3.8.AWSConfig-AutomaticRemediation-ScanResult.png)
  

5. **Config Automatic Remediation**
    - Navigate to `Config` > `Rules`
    - Select (check radio button) the rule that found non compliant resource.
    - Navigate to `Actions` > `Manage remediation` 
    - In remediation action configuration screen provide the following configuration:
      - Select remediation method: `Automatic remediation`
      - Remediation action details: `AWS-StopEC2Instance`
      - Resource ID paramether: `InstanceId`<br>This will populate table below, with leaving one field to populate (ARN ID of the role created):
        - InstanceId: `RECOURCE_ID`
        - AutomationAssumeRole: `<Add ARN role ID>
      - `Save changes`

    - Scroll down to the bottom of `Rules` screen
    - Select non-compliant resource and press `Remediate`
