# Demo:<br>Creating CloudWatch Alarms

![](../img/demo/3.5.CloudWatch-Alarm.png)

<br><br>

### Objectives

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**<br>Enable detailed monitoring at 1-minute intervals
2. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm**<br>The alarm will trigger if CPU utilization exceeds 90% for 1 minute
3. **Configure an Email Alert**<br>Configure CloudWatch to alert us by sending an email using SNS if the alarm is triggered
4. **Max Out Our CPU**<br>Run a command to max out our CPU. This should cause the CloudWatch alarm to trigger, and if our alert is working, we'll also receive an email

<br><br>

## Solution
1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**
    - Enter following `EC2` instance parameters:
        - Name: `demo`
        - Type: `t3.micro`
        - Key pair: `not required`
    - Enable **Detailed CloudWatch monitoring** (1 minute intervals):
        - In `Advanced details` navigate to `Detailed CloudWatch monitoring`
        - Use a drop-down and select `Enable`
    - `Launch instance`


2. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm**
    - Navigate to `CloudWatch` -> `Alarms` -> `All alarms`
    - `Create alarm`
    - Step 1<br>**Specify metric and condition**
      - Click on `Select metric`
      - In `Browse` `Metric` search bar, paste EC2 instance ID.
      - Select `EC2>Per-Instance Metrics` -> `CPUUtilization`
      - Click on `Select metric`
      - Confirm **Metric name** and **InstanceId**
      - Statistic can be changed to min, max, etc. However for this excercise, keep it at average.
      - Change period time to `1 minute` (from 5 minutes)
      - In `Condition` menu:
        - `Threshold`:
          - [x] Static
          - [ ] Anomaly detection
        - `Whenever CPUUtilization is`:
          - [x] Greater
          - [ ] Greater/Equal
          - [ ] Lower/Equal
          - [ ] Lower
        - `than` `90`
      - `Next`
    - Step 2<br>**Configure action**
      - Alarm state trigger:
        - [x] In alarm
        - [ ] OK
        - [ ] Insuficient data
      - Send notification to the following SNS topic: `Create new topic`
        - Name: `Default_CloudWatch_Alerm_Topic`
        - Email endpoint that will receive the notification: `<email>`
        - `Create topic`
      - `Next`
    - Step 3<br>**Add name and decription**
      - Alarm name: `High_CPU_Utilization_Alarm`
      - Description: `High CPU Utilization Alarm`
      - `Next`
    - Step 4<br>**Preview and create**
      - Review configuration and select `Create alarm`

3. **Configure an Email Alert**
    - You have to navigate to your email to confirm subscription to SNS topic. 
    - You should have received email with confirmation link. 
    - Navigate to the link provided in the email to confirm subscription.


4. **Max Out Our CPU**
    - Navigate to created EC2 instance
    - Connect to running instance via **EC2 Connect**
    - Run the following command to max out the CPU:
        ```bash
        for i in 1 2 3 4; do while : ; do : ; done & done
        ```
    - Wait for a minute to satisfy alarm trigger condition
    - Navigate to `CloudWatch` -> `Alarm` -> `In alarm`
    - You should see that alarm has been triggered, and you can select it to see the details.
    - Also at this point you should have received the email notification. The sender will be **AWS Notification** and sumject will be **ALARM: <description of the alarm>**
