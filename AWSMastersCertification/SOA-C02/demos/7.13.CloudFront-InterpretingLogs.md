### Objectives
- **CloudFront Distribution**<br>Use the CloudFront distribution that we created in previous lesson
- **Create an S3 Bucket**<br>Create a new S3 bucket to store our CloudFront logs
- **Enable Logging**<br>Enable logging in our CloudFront distribution setting and generate traffic to our distribution
- **Review the Logs**<br>After a few minutes, we should see some logs appear in S3.<br>When you first enable logging, it can sometimes take a while for logs to appear, due to distributed nature of CloudFront

## Solution
### **CloudFront Logging Lesson Summary**

This lesson walks you through configuring and enabling **CloudFront logs** for a distribution, including generating traffic and analyzing the logs. Here's a concise breakdown for practical use and exam preparation.

---

### **Overview**
1. **Locate Existing CloudFront Distribution**:
   - Find the CloudFront distribution created in the previous lesson.
   - If it no longer exists, recreate it.

2. **Create S3 Bucket for Logs**:
   - Go to the S3 console and create a bucket (e.g., `my-cf-logs-<random-numbers>`).
   - Use the **us-east-1** region.
   - Ensure the bucket is private.

3. **Enable Logging for CloudFront**:
   - In the CloudFront console, edit the distribution settings.
   - Find the **Standard Logging** section and enable it.
   - Select the newly created S3 bucket for log storage.
   - If prompted, enable ACLs to allow CloudFront to write to the bucket.
   - Save the changes.

4. **Generate Traffic to CloudFront**:
   - Use the CloudFront distribution domain name to access the object (e.g., `https://<cloudfront-domain>/ryan_faye.jpeg`).
   - Open the URL in multiple tabs or refresh it multiple times to simulate traffic.

5. **Wait for Logs to Appear**:
   - Logs typically take a few minutes to an hour to appear due to CloudFrontâ€™s distributed nature.
   - Refresh the S3 bucket to check for log files.

6. **Analyze Logs**:
   - Download the log files (zipped format) from the S3 bucket.
   - Extract and open them to view details, such as:
     - Request date and time.
     - HTTP method.
     - Client IP and browser information.
     - Cache behavior (hit, miss, redirect).
