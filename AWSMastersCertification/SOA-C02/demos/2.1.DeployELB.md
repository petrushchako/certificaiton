## Create an Elastic Load Balancer
- Within `EC2 Services` dashboard, scroll down within the menu on the left-hand side and select `Load Balancer`
- Select `Application Load Balancer (ALB)`
- Name: `my-load-balancer`
- Scheme: `Internet-facing`
- IP address type: `IPv4`
- Network Mapping:
  - VPC: default
  - Mapping:
    - [x] us-east-1a
    - [x] us-east-1b
- Security group: 
  - Select `my-web-dmz` (previously created)
  - Remove default security group
- Listener and routing:
  - `Listener HTTP:80`
    - Protocol: `HTTP`
    - Port: `80`
    - Default Action:
      - `Create target group`
      - Target type: `Instances`
      - Target group name: `my-target-group`
      - Protocol: `HTTP:80`
      - VPC: `default`
      - Protocol version: `HTTP1`
      - Health checks:
        - Protocol: `HTTP`
        - Path: `/index.html`
      - Scroll to the bottom and select `Next` (to the `Register targets` screen)
      - Select `web-server-1` and `web-server-2` instances.
      - Confirm the port (e.g. `80`)
      - Select `Include as pending below`
      - Complete target group configuration by selecting `Create target group`
    - In `Listeners and routing` select refresh button, and previously created target group shoud be available for selection in drop-down manu.
- Complete ELB creation by selecting `Create load balancer`


## Test 
- Once the ELB instance goes into `Active` status, open EMB details by selecting instance name
- Copy the DNS name (i.e. `my-load-balancer-48064029.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`)
- Open copied link in the browser window
- You should see the content of bootstrap script diplayed to you `Hello Cloud Gurus`
