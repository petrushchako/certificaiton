# Demo:<br>Exploring CloudWatch Logs Insights


### CloudWatch Logs Insights
- Interactive query and analysis
- For data stored in CloudWatch Logs
- Bespoke query language
- Query and filter the logs directly
- Generate visualizations, e.g., bar graph, line graph, or pie chart


### Objectives
1. **Create a Basic Lambda Function**<br>A new log group is automatically created, enabling it to send logs to CloudWatch
2. **Test**<br>Test that our function is working, which will generate some log events
3. **Explore CloudWatch Logs Insights**<br>Explore how we can use CloudWatch Logs Insights to analyze our log data
4. **Review Sample Queries**<br>Review some of the sample queries that are available

<br><br>

## Solution

> **Steps 1-2**<br><br>
> Reuse instruction from 3.3 demo to complete steps 1-2


3. **Explore CloudWatch Logs Insights**
   - Navigate to `CloudWatch` -> `Logs` -> `Logs Insights`
   - In the search bar, find the log group you would like to query
   - Insights will suggest sample query you can execute to:

    ```sql
    field @timestamp, @message
    | sort @timestamp desc
    | limit 20
    ```
   
<br>

4. **Review Sample Queries**
    - To review sample queries, select `Queries` on the right side menu
    - In the popup menu select `Lambda` -> `Find the most expensive requests`
    - You can select `Apply` to insert query into input box
    - Use `Run query` to execute

    > **Lambda**<br>
    > `Find the most expensive requests` query
    > ```sql
    > filter @type = "REPORT"
    > | field @requestId, @billedDuration
    > | sort by @billedDuration desc
    > ```

    > VPC Flow Logs<br>
    > `IP addresses using UDP transfer protocol` query
    > ```sql
    > filter protocol
    > | stats count(*) by srcAddr
    > ```

5. **Visualization**<br>
    - To visuzalize the data, navigate to `Visualization` tab in `Log Insights` (at the bottom of the screen, below the query input window)
