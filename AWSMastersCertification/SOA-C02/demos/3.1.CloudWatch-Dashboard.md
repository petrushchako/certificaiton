    - Launch EC2 instance (AMI2, t3.micro), no key pair.
    - Select instance in **EC2 > Instances** view and connect to it (using EC2 instance connect).
    - To generate CPU load, run the following command in connected EC2 instance:

    - Name: `my-production-systems`
    - In **Add widget** select `Line` (Compare metrics over time)
    - From which data source would you like to create the widget?: `Metrics` (Create widget based on Metrics and configure your widget on the next step)
    - In **Browse** section select `EC2` > `Per-Instance Metrics` and use instance ID to find all default metrics avaialble for that `EC2`
    - Select `CPUUtilization`. If you scroll up to the Intitled graph, you should see metrics being visualized.
