![](../img/demo/3.1.CloudWatch-Dashboards.png)

<br><br>

1. **Launch EC2 Instance**<br>Generate some activity on our instance to create some metrics.
    - Launch EC2 instance (AMI2, t3.micro), no key pair.
    - Select instance in **EC2 > Instances** view and connect to it (using EC2 instance connect).
    - To generate CPU load, run the following command in connected EC2 instance:
        `while true; do echo; done`


2. **Create a CloudWatch Deshboard**<br>Explore the metrics that are available.
    - Navigate to `CloudWatch` service
    - Go to `Dashboards` and select `Create dashboard`
    - Name: `my-production-systems`
    - In **Add widget** select `Line` (Compare metrics over time)
    - From which data source would you like to create the widget?: `Metrics` (Create widget based on Metrics and configure your widget on the next step)
    - In **Browse** section select `EC2` > `Per-Instance Metrics` and use instance ID to find all default metrics avaialble for that `EC2`
    - Select `CPUUtilization`. If you scroll up to the Intitled graph, you should see metrics being visualized.
    - Select `Create widget`

3. **Add Some Widgets**<br>Add some widgets to the dashboard to display metrics about our EC2 instance.
    - From the created dashboard (`my-production-system`), select `+` sign on the top-right hand side to add widget. 
    - Select `Line`
    - Then `Metrics`
    - In browse menu select `EC2` > `Per-Instance Metrics` 
    - Search for instance ID
    - Select `NetworkPacketsIn`
    - Then repeat the same steps from section 3, but select `NetworkPacketsOut`
    - After configuring all of the widgets, make sure to save configuration by pressing `Save` from dashboard view. 

> **Note**<br><br>
> - By default EC2 sends metrics to CloudWatch every 5 minutes
> - You can select metrics from different regions
