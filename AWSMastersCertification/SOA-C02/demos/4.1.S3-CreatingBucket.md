## Solution
1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
    - Navigate to `S3` and select `Create bucket`
    - In General configuration you need to provide values that will comprise a dns name, which has to be globally unique.
      - Bucket name: `my-first-bucket-53525758`
      - AWS Region: `us-east-1`
    - Object Ownership: `ACL disabled (recommended)`(default)
    - Block Public Access settings for this bucket: `Block all public access`
    - Bucket Versioning: `Disable`
    - Encryption type: `Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 keys (SSE-S3)`
    - Bucket Key: `Enable`
    - **Advanced settings** hold configuration to object lock configuration (i.e. Write Once Read Many (WORM) model), which prevents objects from being modified or overwitten for a fix amount of time or you can also set it to indefinitely:<br>Object Lock: `Disable`
    - `Create bucket`
