# Demo:<br>Working With EFS

![](../img/demo/4.4.EFS.png)

<br>

### Objectives
1. **Create an EFS File System**<br>Note that in the console, encryption is enabled by default.
2. **Launch an EC2 Instance**<br>Install the Amazon EFS utilities on our instance.
3. **Mount the File System**<br>Create a new directory on our EC2 instance. Mount the EFS file system to our new directory and create a file.

<br>

## Solution
1. **Create an EFS File System**
   - Navigate to `EFS` from AWS console
   - Select `Create file system` and provide following
     - **Step 1**<br>File system settings
     - Name: `MyEFS`
     - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): `vpc - 012345... default`
     - Select `Customize`
       - Storage class: `Standard` (multiple AZ zones)
       - Automatic backups: `Enable automatic backups`
       - Encryption: `Enable encryption of data at rest` (default encryption key, however you can modify it in **Customize encryption settings**)
       - Throughput mode:
         - [x] `Enhanced` (best performance)
         - [ ] `Bursting` (cheaper, for smaller apps, allows throughput to grow with the size of EFS)
       - `Elastic(recommended)` for unpredictable workloads (**Provisioned** is another option)
       - In **Additional settings** section, you can modify Performance mode. Default mode is `General Purpose`, however, if you have a lot of machines connecting to EFS and your setup requires high performance, you can select `Max I/O`. 
       > `Max I/O` can only be used in combination with `Provisioned` throughput option. If you use `Elastic` throughput option, the `Max I/O` option will be grayed-out and unavailable for selection.
       - `Next`
     - **Step 2**<br>Network access<br>This is where you configure your mount target(s). A mount target provides an NFSv4 endpoint at which you can mount an Amazon EFS file system. AWS recommend creating one mount target per Availability Zone.
     - VPC user in example is configured in `us-east-1` and six different targets (one for each AZ (i.e. us-east-1a,...,us-east-1f)) available by default.
     - `Next`
     - **Step 3**<br>File system policy
     - You can enfoce ceratin rules via EFS Policy:
       - [ ] Prevent root access by default
       - [ ] Enforce read-only access by default
       - [ ] Prevent anonymous access
       - [x] Enforce in-transit encryption for all clients
     - `Next`
     - **Step 4**<br>Review and create
     - Review and `Create`
