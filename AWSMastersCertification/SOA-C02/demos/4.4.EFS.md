# Demo:<br>Working With EFS

![](../img/demo/4.4.EFS.png)

<br>

### Objectives
1. **Create an EFS File System**<br>Note that in the console, encryption is enabled by default.
2. **Launch an EC2 Instance**<br>Install the Amazon EFS utilities on our instance.
3. **Mount the File System**<br>Create a new directory on our EC2 instance. Mount the EFS file system to our new directory and create a file.

<br>

## Solution
1. **Create an EFS File System**
   - Navigate to `EFS` from AWS console
   - Select `Create file system` and provide following
     - **Step 1**<br>File system settings
     - Name: `MyEFS`
     - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): `vpc - 012345... default`
     - Select `Customize`
       - Storage class: `Standard` (multiple AZ zones)
       - Automatic backups: `Enable automatic backups`
       - Encryption: `Enable encryption of data at rest` (default encryption key, however you can modify it in **Customize encryption settings**)
       - Throughput mode:
         - [x] `Enhanced` (best performance)
         - [ ] `Bursting` (cheaper, for smaller apps, allows throughput to grow with the size of EFS)
       - `Elastic(recommended)` for unpredictable workloads (**Provisioned** is another option)
       - In **Additional settings** section, you can modify Performance mode. Default mode is `General Purpose`, however, if you have a lot of machines connecting to EFS and your setup requires high performance, you can select `Max I/O`. 
       > `Max I/O` can only be used in combination with `Provisioned` throughput option. If you use `Elastic` throughput option, the `Max I/O` option will be grayed-out and unavailable for selection.
       - `Next`
     - **Step 2**<br>Network access<br>This is where you configure your mount target(s). A mount target provides an NFSv4 endpoint at which you can mount an Amazon EFS file system. AWS recommend creating one mount target per Availability Zone.
     - VPC user in example is configured in `us-east-1` and six different targets (one for each AZ (i.e. us-east-1a,...,us-east-1f)) available by default.
     - `Next`
     - **Step 3**<br>File system policy
     - You can enfoce ceratin rules via EFS Policy:
       - [ ] Prevent root access by default
       - [ ] Enforce read-only access by default
       - [ ] Prevent anonymous access
       - [x] Enforce in-transit encryption for all clients
     - `Next`
     - **Step 4**<br>Review and create
     - Review and `Create`

<br>

2. **Launch an EC2 Instance**
    - Name: `EFS Client`
    - OS: `Amazon Linux`
    - Type: `t3.micro`
    - Network: 
      - Create new SG, and name it `EFS Client SG`. Leave everything on default.

<br>

3. **Mount the File System**
   - **Prepare EFS**
   - Navigate to EFS and select previously created instance
   - Navigate to `Network` tab and take a note of SG group assigned
   - In order to allow our EC2 instance to connect to EFS file system we need to update the security group.
   - Navigate back to `EC2` > `Security Groups`<br>Security group from EFS should be listed in this window. Click on the SG name to open its configuration
   - Scroll down to Inbound rules and select `Edit inbound rules`
   - Press `Add rule` and provide following details:
    - Type: `NFS`
    - Protocol: `TCP`
    - Port: `2049`
    - Source: `Custom`
    - In security SG search window, find the SG group created with EC2 instance (i.e. `EFS Client SG`) and select it.
    - `Save rules`<br><br>
  - **Bind EFS to EC2**
  - Login to EC2 using *EC2 Instance Connect*
  - Install EFS mount helper utility on EC2 instance(part of Amazon EFS utils package): 
    - `sudo dnf isntall -y amazon-efs-utils`
  - Create a mount point on EC2, by creating directory:
    - `sudo mkdir efs`
  - Extract EFS mounting instructions:
    > **Mounting instructions retrieval**:
    > 1. Click on `EFS` instance name
    > 2. Select `Attach`
    > 3. Copy commands to be executed on EC2 instance(s) to mount to EFS
  - Mount EFS to EC2 by executing extracted command (Using the EFS mount heper option):
    - `sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-06b37762c6bc42fd1:/ efs`
    - Explanation:
      - Mount (`mount`) a file system of type EFS (`-t efs`) using transport option of TLS (`-o tls`) providing EFS ID (`fs-06b37762c6bc42fd1:/`) and we are mounting that file system to our local directory (`efs`)
  - Verify successful mounting by executing `df -t`. EFS mounting should show up in the list.

## Test
1. Chagne to EFS mounted directory an create a file:
   ```sh
   cd efs
   echo "Test file content" > test.txt
   ls
   ```
