## Solution
### Lecture Notes: Configuring a Route 53 Geolocation Routing Policy

---

#### **Lesson Objectives:**
1. Launch and configure two EC2 instances for the demonstration.
2. Set up and install **httpd** on the instances to display custom webpages.
3. Create an A record in Route 53 with a **geolocation-based routing policy**.
4. Test geolocation routing functionality by simulating user traffic from different locations.

<br>

#### **Step 1: Launching EC2 Instances**
- Go to the AWS Management Console, search for **EC2**, and create two instances:
  1. **Instance WS1**:
     - Name: WS1.
     - AMI: Amazon Linux.
     - Instance Type: `t3.micro`.
     - Security Group: Configure to allow HTTP traffic on port 80.
     - User Data: Add a bootstrap script to install and configure a website that displays a message:
       > *"This version of the website is for customers located in [UK or your country]."*
  2. **Instance WS2**:
     - Name: WS2.
     - Similar configuration as WS1.
     - Modify the user data to display a message:
       > *"This version of the website is for customers located in [a different country, e.g., Barbados]."*
