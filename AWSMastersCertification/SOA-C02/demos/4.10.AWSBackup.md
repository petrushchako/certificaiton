   - **Backup Window**: Set to start at **5:00 AM UTC** for a duration of 8 hours (customizable).
   - **Transition to Cold Storage**: Optional; if transitioning to cold storage, set a minimum retention period of 90 days after transitioning.
   - **Retention Period**: Set to **35 days** (default).
   - **Cross-Region Copy** (Optional): Optionally create a copy in a different region.

5. Click **Save backup rule** and select **Create plan**.

### Assign Resources to the Backup Plan
1. After creating the plan, select **Configure resource assignment**.

   - **Retention Period**: Set to **1 day**.
   - **Backup vault**: Use the default.
6. Click **Create on-demand backup**.
