  - AMI: Amazon Linux
  - Instance Type: `t3.micro`
  - IAM Role: Create and attach a role with Amazon S3 Full Access.
    - **Steps to Create IAM Role:**
      1. Go to IAM -> Create Role.
      2. Select **AWS Service** and **EC2** as the use case.
      3. Attach the **AmazonS3FullAccess** policy.
      4. Name the role (e.g., `MyEC2S3Role`) and create it.
      5. Attach the role to the instance during its configuration.

- **Networking Configuration:**
  - Ensure the instance is in the default VPC.
