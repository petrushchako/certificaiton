<br>

## Solution

### Step 1: Enable Amazon GuardDuty

### Step 2: Review GuardDuty Settings

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the left-hand menu.
2. Take note of your **detector ID** (identifies your GuardDuty instance).
3. Observe:
   - Findings are automatically sent to **CloudWatch Events**.

   - Options to export findings to an **S3 bucket** (optional).

<br>

### Step 3: Generate Sample Findings

1. In the **Settings** menu, locate the **Sample Findings** section.
2. Click **Generate Sample Findings**.
   - This will generate one sample finding for each finding type GuardDuty can detect.
3. A message will appear confirming that the sample findings have been successfully generated.

<br>

### Step 4: Explore Sample Findings

1. Navigate to **Findings** in the left-hand menu.
2. Observe the list of generated findings, which are sorted by:
   - **Severity Levels**:
     - **Red triangle**: High severity.
     - **Yellow square**: Medium severity.
     - **Blue circle**: Low severity.
   - **Finding Types**:
     - Click the arrow icon to sort by type or severity.
     - Focus on high-severity findings for critical issues.
3. Click on a specific finding to view details:
   - **Example**: Select the "S3 Malicious IP Caller" finding.
     - View details such as:
       - **Finding ID**.
       - **Explanation** (e.g., S3 API call from a known malicious IP).
       - **Resources affected**.
       - Information about the **remote actor**.

<br>

### Step 5: Analyze Other Findings

1. Review other types of sample findings to understand GuardDuty’s capabilities:
   - **Compromised EC2 Instances**:
     - Example: An EC2 instance used for a **DDoS attack** or **Bitcoin mining**.
   - **Anomalous IAM User Behavior**:
     - Example: Unusual activity detected based on user’s historical behavior.
2. Note how GuardDuty uses **machine learning** to identify patterns of normal behavior and flag anomalies.

### Step 6: Understand Threat Detection

1. GuardDuty’s findings provide insights into:
   - Evidence of **account compromise**.
   - **Unusual API calls**.
   - Attempts to **disable CloudTrail**.
   - **Reconnaissance activities** (e.g., port scanning, failed logins).
   - **Compromised S3 buckets** or EC2 instances.
