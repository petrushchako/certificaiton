# Demo:<br>S3 Multipart Upload

Multipart Upload allows uploading large files by splitting them into smaller parts and uploading them in parallel. Here's how to perform a multipart upload using both **AWS CLI** and **cURL**.

### **1. Using AWS CLI**

#### **Steps**
1. **Initiate Multipart Upload**  
   This step returns an `UploadId` to track the multipart upload.
   ```bash
   aws s3api create-multipart-upload --bucket my-bucket --key largefile.txt
   ```
   Example Response:
   ```json
   {
       "UploadId": "exampleUploadId123"
   }
   ```

2. **Upload Parts**
   Split the file and upload each part using the `UploadId`.  
   Example for uploading part 1:
   ```bash
   aws s3api upload-part --bucket my-bucket --key largefile.txt --part-number 1 --body part1.txt --upload-id exampleUploadId123
   ```
   Example Response:
   ```json
   {
       "ETag": "\"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\""
   }
   ```

   Repeat for all parts, incrementing the `--part-number`.

3. **Complete Multipart Upload**
   Provide the `UploadId` and the `ETag` for each uploaded part:
   ```bash
   aws s3api complete-multipart-upload --bucket my-bucket --key largefile.txt \
   --upload-id exampleUploadId123 \
   --multipart-upload '{"Parts":[{"ETag":"\"etag1\"","PartNumber":1},{"ETag":"\"etag2\"","PartNumber":2}]}'
   ```
