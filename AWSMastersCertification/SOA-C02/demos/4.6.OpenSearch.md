### Objectives
1. **Create an Opensearch Domain**<br>Select the Production deployment type: Muti-AZ, with dedicated master node for higher availability.
2. **Explore the Network Configuration**<br>We can make our claster publicly accessible or keep it private within our own VPC. We'll make it public.
3. **Connect to Our Public Endpoint**<br>When the domain has been initialized, we can see our nodes and connect to our public endpoint.
4. **Note**<br>Note that after a domain is created, you ***cannot remove the public endpoint or make it private***
