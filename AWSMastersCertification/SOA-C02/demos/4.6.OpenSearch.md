# Demo:<br>Creating an Amazon OpenSearch Service Domain

<br>

### Objectives
1. **Create an Opensearch Domain**<br>Select the Production deployment type: Muti-AZ, with dedicated master node for higher availability.
2. **Explore the Network Configuration**<br>We can make our claster publicly accessible or keep it private within our own VPC. We'll make it public.
3. **Connect to Our Public Endpoint**<br>When the domain has been initialized, we can see our nodes and connect to our public endpoint.
4. **Note**<br>Note that after a domain is created, you ***cannot remove the public endpoint or make it private***

<br>

## Solution
### **Create an Opensearch Domain**
- navigate to `Amazon OpenSearch Service` in AWS console
- In `Manage clusters`/`Dashboard` select `Create domain`
- Domain name: `my-opensearch-domain`
- Domain creation method: `Standard create`
- Templates: `Production`
- Deployment Option: `Domain with standby`
- Engine options: `<latest version>`
- Data nodes: 
  - Instance type: `r5g.large.search`
  - Number of nodes: `3`
  - Storage: `EBS`
  - EBS volume type: `General Purpose (SSD) - gp3`
  - EBS storage size per node: `10`
- Dedicated master nodes:
  - Instance type: `m6g.large.search`
  - Number of master nodes: `3`
- Custom endpoint. In this section you can provide your custom endpoint if you own DNS domain name. Othervise leave `Enable custom endpoint` unchecked, which will auto-generate the endpoint.
- Network: `Public access`
- Fine-grained access control: `Enable fine-grained access control` (enabled)
- Master user: `Create master user`:
  - Master username: `alex`
  - Master password: `<password>`
- SAML authentication for OpenSearch Dashboard/Kibana: `Disabled`
- Amazon Cognito authentication: `Disabled`
- Access policy: `Only use fine-grained access control`
- Since we previously enabled **Fine-grained access control**, encryption at rest and in transit is enabled by default. 
- Encryption/Choose an AWS KMS key: `Use an AWS owned key`
- Off-peak window: `Time range when software updates will ne installed`
- Auto-tune: `Turn-on`
- `Create` (takes aproximatelly 10 minutes to finalize the installation)
