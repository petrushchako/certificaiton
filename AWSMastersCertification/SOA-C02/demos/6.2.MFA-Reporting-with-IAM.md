## Solution

### Step 1: Configure MFA for the Root Account  
1. Log in to your **AWS Management Console**.  
2. From the console, search for **IAM** and navigate to the IAM dashboard.  
3. In the **Security Recommendations** section, locate the alert for configuring MFA.  
4. Click **Add MFA** and proceed with assigning a new MFA device.  
5. Select **Virtual MFA Device** and follow these steps:  
   - Install an app like **Google Authenticator** or **Authy** on your smartphone.  
   - Scan the QR code generated in the AWS console with your app.  
   - Enter two consecutive MFA codes displayed by the app in the console.  
6. Click **Assign MFA** to complete the setup.  
7. Log out and verify that the MFA is working by logging back in. You'll be prompted to enter the MFA code generated by the app before accessing the console.  

### Step 2: Create an IAM User Without MFA Enabled  
1. In the IAM dashboard, navigate to **Users** and click **Add users**.  
2. Enter a username (e.g., "Robbie").  
3. Select the **Access type** as desired (e.g., AWS Management Console access).  
4. Create a group for the user:  
   - Click **Create group**, name it (e.g., "Admin"), and attach a policy (e.g., AdministratorAccess).  
   - Add the user to this group.  
5. Proceed with the remaining steps and click **Create user**.  
6. The user will now appear in the **Users** list.  

### Step 3: Download and Analyze the Credential Report  
1. In the IAM dashboard, go to **Access reports** on the left-hand menu.  
2. Select **Credential Report** and click **Download credentials report**.  
3. Open the downloaded CSV file in a spreadsheet application.  
4. Review the following key fields:  
   - **User Name**: Displays all users in the account.  
   - **MFA Active**: Indicates whether MFA is enabled for each user.  
5. Confirm that MFA is set to `true` for the root account and note that the new IAM user does not have MFA enabled.
