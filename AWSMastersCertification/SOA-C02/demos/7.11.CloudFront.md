### Objectives
- Create an S3 bucket.
- Access an image from the S3 bucket.
- Create a CloudFront distribution.
- Access the image using CloudFront<br>Compare the response time.

## Solution
### **Create an S3 Bucket**
1. **Region Selection**: Use `us-east-1` if working in AWS Sandbox; otherwise, choose a region far from your location (e.g., Sydney for the demonstration).
2. **Bucket Configuration**:
   - Disable "Block Public Access Settings."
   - Acknowledge the warning and create the bucket.

3. **Add a Bucket Policy**:
   - Navigate to **Permissions → Bucket Policy → Edit**.
   - Use the provided `bucket_policy.json` to allow public read access.
   - Update the bucket name in the policy.
   - Ensure the bucket name ends with `/*` for access to all objects.

4. **Upload a File**:
   - Choose a file (e.g., `cute_dog.jpeg` ~6.3MB).
   - Upload via **Objects → Upload → Add Files**.
   - Note the latency when accessing files in a distant region.

#### **Access the File**
- Use the **Object URL** to check the latency for file loading, especially for regions far from your location.

### **CloudFront Distribution Setup**
1. **Search for CloudFront**: Open it in a new tab and select **Create Distribution**.
2. **Configure Origin**:
   - Select the S3 bucket as the origin.
   - Leave the **Origin Path** blank unless you have folder-specific requirements.
   - For origin access, stick with the default settings for now.

3. **Cache Behavior**:
   - **Viewer Protocol Policy**: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
   - **Allowed HTTP Methods**: Choose appropriate methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT).
   - **Restrict Viewer Access**: Use signed URLs or cookies for restricted content access.

4. **Cache Policy and TTL**:
   - Default **TTL**: 24 hours (86,000 seconds).
   - Adjust TTL for dynamic files that change more frequently.

5. **Function Associations** (Optional):
   - Add custom functions to customize HTTP responses.

6. **Price Class**:
   - Control which edge locations serve content. 
   - Restricting regions can save money but may impact performance.

7. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
   - Use AWS WAF to filter traffic and prevent common attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

8. **Domain Names and SSL Certificates**:
   - Use a custom domain if needed.
   - CloudFront provides an SSL certificate by default; you can also use one from the AWS Certificate Manager.

9. **Logging and IPv6**:
   - Enable logging for traffic analysis and diagnostics.

10. **Create Distribution**: Takes several minutes to provision the configuration to all edge locations.
