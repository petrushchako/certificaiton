- Access the image using CloudFront<br>Compare the response time.

<br><br>

## Solution
### **Create an S3 Bucket**
1. **Region Selection**: Use `us-east-1` if working in AWS Sandbox; otherwise, choose a region far from your location (e.g., Sydney for the demonstration).
2. **Bucket Configuration**:
   - Disable "Block Public Access Settings."
   - Acknowledge the warning and create the bucket.

3. **Add a Bucket Policy**:
   - Navigate to **Permissions → Bucket Policy → Edit**.
   - Use the provided `bucket_policy.json` to allow public read access.
   - Update the bucket name in the policy.
   - Ensure the bucket name ends with `/*` for access to all objects.

4. **Upload a File**:
   - Choose a file (e.g., `cute_dog.jpeg` ~6.3MB).
   - Upload via **Objects → Upload → Add Files**.
   - Note the latency when accessing files in a distant region.

#### **Access the File**
- Use the **Object URL** to check the latency for file loading, especially for regions far from your location.
