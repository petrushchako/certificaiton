<br><br>


### Objectives
- **Launch an EC2 Instance**<br>Attach an IAM role with permissions to send CloudWatch Agent metrics to CloudWatch
- **Install the CloudWatch Agent**<br>Configure the agent to send operating system metrics and logs to CloudWatch
- **View Metrics in CLoudWatch**We should be able to see the EC2 default metrics as well as the metrics and logs sent by the CloudWatch Agent.

<br>

## Launch an EC2 Instance (IAM preparation)
- Navigate to `IAM` in AWS console.
- In `Access managment` select `Roles`
- Select `Create role`
  - **Step 1**:
    - Trusted entity type: `AWS service`
    - Use case `EC2`
    - `Next`
  - **Step 2**:
    - Add `CloudWatchAgentServicePolicy`
    - `Next`
  - **Step 3**:
    - Role name: `EC2CWRole`
    - `Create role`

<br>

## Launch an EC2 Instance
- Name: `My EC2 Instance`
- OS: `AMI2`
- Type: `t3.micro`
- Key pair: `Proceed without a key pair`
- Advanced details:
  - IAM instance pofile: `EC2CWRole`
  - User data:<br>Add bootstrap script 
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    dnf update -y
    ```
<br>

## Install CloudWatch Agent
- Open created instance by using **EC2 instance connect**
- Install `rsyslog` which will generate a readable text file of the operating system messages in var/log/messages
    ```sh
    sudo su
    dnf install rsyslog
    systemctl start rsyslog
    systemctl enable rsyslog
    ```

- Install the CloudWatch Agent:
    ```sh
    sudo dnf install amazon-cloudwatch-agent -y
    ```

    cat config.json
    ```

- Start the CloudWatch Agent

    ```sh
    /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json
    ```

- Generate some activity on our system by installing stress:

    ```sh
    dnf install stress -y
    stress --cpu 1
    ```
