# Demo:<br>Route 53 Simple Routing Policy

### Objectives
- **Launch an EC2 Instance**<br>Install `httpd`
- **Use Route 53 to Create an A Record**<br>Create an A record with a simple routing policy to map a friendly domain name to our web server
- **Test**<br>Access our website using our own domain name.

## Solution
## Launch an EC2 Instance
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.

3. Configure the instance:
   - **Name**: `My Web Server`
   - **AMI**: Amazon Linux 2
   - **Instance Type**: `t3.micro`
   - **Key Pair**: Proceed without a key pair
   - **Network Settings**:
     - Create a new security group named `Web DMZ`.
     - Allow **HTTP (port 80)** and remove the default SSH rule.
4. Scroll down to **Advanced Details** and locate the **User Data** section.
5. Copy and paste the following bootstrap script:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    echo "<html><body><h1>Hello Cloud Gurus</h1></body></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    ```

6. Click on **Launch Instance**.
