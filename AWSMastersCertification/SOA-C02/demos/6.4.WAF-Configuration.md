# Demo:<br>Configuring AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)


### Objectives:
1. Create a sample API using **API Gateway**.
2. Use **AWS WAF** to create a Web ACL (Access Control List) that blocks traffic from a specific location.
3. Test and verify that the Web ACL works as intended.

## Solution
## Create a Sample API Using API Gateway
1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Search for **API Gateway** in the services search bar and select it.
3. Click **Build** under the **REST API** section.
4. Use the pre-populated Swagger example code:
   - Review the code provided in the template (a simple web application).
   - Scroll to the bottom and select **Import** to load the example code.
5. Deploy the API:
   - From the **Actions** menu, select **Deploy API**.
   - For the deployment stage:
     - Choose **New Stage**.
     - Name the stage `Testing`.
     - Click **Deploy**.
6. Note the **Invoke URL** displayed after deployment. This URL will be used later for testing.

## Create a Web ACL in AWS WAF
1. Open the **AWS Management Console** in a new tab.
2. Search for and select **AWS WAF**.
3. Click **Create Web ACL**.
4. Configure the Web ACL:
   - **Name**: `Block-API-Calls-From-<Your-Country>` (e.g., `Block-API-Calls-From-UK`).
   - **Description**: Use the same name or an appropriate description.
   - **Resource Type**: Select **Regional Resources**.
   - **Region**: Choose the region where the API Gateway is deployed (e.g., `US East`).
5. Associate the API Gateway resource:
   - Click **Add AWS Resources**.
   - Select **API Gateway** as the resource type.
   - Choose the API created earlier and click **Add**.
   - Click **Next**.

## Add a Rule to Block Traffic
1. Click **Add Rules** and select **Add My Own Rules and Rule Group**.
2. Configure the rule:
   - **Rule Name**: Enter a meaningful name (e.g., `Block-Traffic-From-UK`).
   - **Type**: Regular Rule.
   - **Statement**: Configure the rule to block requests originating from a specific country.
     - Set the **Condition** to "Originates from a country".
     - Select the **Country Code** (e.g., `UK`).
   - Action: Set the action to **Block**.
3. Click **Add Rule** and proceed by clicking **Next**.

<br>

## Configure and Review Settings
1. **Priority**: Skip or leave default settings.
2. **CloudWatch Metrics**: Accept the default metric configuration.
3. Review all settings and click **Create Web ACL**.

<br>

## Test the Web ACL
1. Go back to the API Gateway console.
2. Copy the **Invoke URL** from Step 1 and open it in your browser.
   - If the ACL has not yet propagated, you may still access the API temporarily.
   - Wait for 5-10 minutes for the changes to take effect globally.
3. Try accessing the API again:
   - If the Web ACL is active, you should see a **"Forbidden"** message.

<br>

## Step 6: Verify Blocked Requests in AWS WAF
1. Return to the AWS WAF console.
2. Select the newly created Web ACL (`Block-API-Calls-From-<Your-Country>`).
3. Go to the **Overview** section and scroll down to **Sample Requests**.
4. Verify that requests from the specified country are being blocked.
