# Demo:<br>Leveraging Presigned URLs with S3

![](../img/demo/4.7.S3-PresignedURLs.png)

<br>

### Objectives
1. **Create an S3 Bucket**<br>Upload a file to the bucket.
2. **Create a Presigned URL**<br>Select the object and, from the **Actions** menu, select **Share with a presigned URL**.
3. **Test the Presigned URL**<br>Attempt to access the file using the presigned URL.
4. **Try to Access Our File Anonymously**<br>Try to access the file anonymously. We should see an **Access Denied** message.

<br>

## Solution
1. Create S3 with unique name and leave everything else on default
2. Upload a file
3. Retrieve persigned URL:
   - Select upload file's checkbox
   - Select `Actions`/`Share with a presigned URL`
   - Select time for URL expiry (up to 12 hours)
   - `Create presigned URL` (note: URL will be copied to your clipboard)
4. Paste generated URL in new browser window and access it. File should be displayed in browser (e.g. photo file). 
5. To verify that file is not accessible directly via object URL, select the file and in **Properties** copy the Object URL (e.g. https://<bucketname>.s3.amazonaws.com/<filename>). You should receive following message:
   
    ```xml
    <Error>
      <Code>AccessDenied</Code>
      <Message>Access Denied</Message>
      <HostId>.......</HostId>
    </Error>
    ```
