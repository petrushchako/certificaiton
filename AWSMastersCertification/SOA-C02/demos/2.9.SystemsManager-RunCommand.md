# Demo:<br>Using AWS Systems Manager EC2 Run Command

![](../img/demo/2.9.SystemsManager-RunCommand.png)

<br>

1. **Create an IAM Role**<br>Attach the policy `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`

> Follow steps from demo 2.8 section 1

2. **Launch Two EC2 Instances**<br>Attach the role we just created.

> Follow steps from demo 2.8 section 2. The only difference is to set the number of instances to `2`


3. **Open the Systems Manager Console**<br>Use EC2 Run Command to run a simple command on our instances.
    - Navigate to `Systems Manager` -> `Node Management` -> `Run Command`
    - In Commands tab, select `Run Command`
    - In Command documents search and select `AWS-RunShellScript`
    - In command parameters add script that will display network interface configuration:
        ```sh
        ifconfig -a
        ```
    - Optionally you can configure `Working Directory` and `Execution Timeout`(default if 1 hour)
    - In **Targer section** select:
      - [ ] Specify instance tags
      - [x] Choose instances manually
      - [ ] Choose a resource group
        > **Important note!**<br><br>
        > If your EC2 instances are not visible for selection, it means that either your forgot to apply or created a wrong IAM role that should enable EC2 communication for Systems Manager (`AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`)

    - In **Output options** disable `Enable an S3 bucket` option
