![](../img/6.1.LabDiagram.png)

<br>

### Objectives
1. Create and AIM policy for S3 access
2. Create an IAM role for an EC2 instance
3. Create an EC2 instance using the created role
4. Test the IAM roles/policies using the AWS CLI

<br>

## Solution  
### Step 1: Create an IAM Policy for S3 Access  
1. Open the **IAM** console and select **Policies** from the left-hand menu.  
2. Click **Create Policy** and choose the **Visual Editor**.  
3. Choose the **S3** service.  
   - Under **Actions**, select:  
     - **List**: All List Actions.  
     - **Read**: All Read Actions.  
4. For the resource, grant access to **All Resources** for this demo.  
5. Skip **Request Conditions** and proceed to review.  
6. Name the policy as **My S3 List Read Policy**, add a description, and click **Create Policy**.  
7. Verify the policy by locating it in the policies list and reviewing the auto-generated JSON.  

<br>

### Step 2: Create an IAM Role for EC2  
1. From the **IAM** console, select **Roles** in the left-hand menu.  
2. Click **Create Role** and choose **AWS Service** as the trusted entity.  
3. Under **Use Cases**, select **EC2** and click **Next**.  
4. Attach the previously created policy (**My S3 List Read Policy**) and proceed.  
5. Name the role as **My S3 List Read Role** and click **Create Role**.  

<br>

### Step 3: Launch an EC2 Instance with the Role  
1. Open the **EC2** console and click **Launch Instance**.  
2. Configure the instance:  
   - Name: **My Instance With Role**.  
   - Image: **Amazon Linux 2** AMI.  
   - Instance Type: **T3 Micro**.  
   - No key pair required for this demo.  
3. In the **Advanced Details** section:  
   - Under **IAM Instance Profile**, select **My S3 List Read Role**.  
4. Launch the instance.  

<br>

### Step 4: Test IAM Role and Policy Using AWS CLI  
1. From the EC2 console, connect to the instance using **EC2 Instance Connect**.  
2. Run the following command to list S3 buckets:  
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls
   ```  
   - Verify that the previously created S3 bucket appears.  

3. Test writing to S3 by creating and attempting to upload a file:  
   - Create a test file:  
     ```bash
     echo "This is a test" > test_file.txt
     ```  
   - Attempt to copy it to the S3 bucket:  
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp test_file.txt s3://<your-bucket-name>
     ```  
   - Verify that the action is denied (due to lack of write permissions).
