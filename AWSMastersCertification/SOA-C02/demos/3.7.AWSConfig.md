# Demo:<br>Using AWS Config

![](../img/demo/3.7.AWSConfig.png)

<br><br>

### Objectives
1. **Create an S3 Bucket**<br>Accept the default settings
2. **Create an AWS Config Rule**<br>Create a rule in AWS Config which checks that bucket versioning is enabled. We'll use the `s3-bucket-versioning-enabled` managed rule
3. **After the Rule Is Evaluated**<br>Config should report that our S3 bucket is non-compliant

<br>

## Solution
1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
    - From AWS Console find the `S3`
    - Select `Create bucket`
    - Enter name `my-s3-bucket-<random_numbers>`
    - Create bucket with all default parameters

2. **Create an AWS Config Rule**

    - ***Initialization***
    - Search for `Config` in AWS Console
    - If you haven't used `Config` you have to set it up for the very first time. Use `1-click setup` 

        > Config storage
        > 
        > Config uses S3 bucket to track the history of AWS resources changes. You can find the bucket service will be using, see the **Step3/Delivery method** parameter
    - Click `Confirm` to initialize the Config service<br><br>

    - ***Create rule***
    - In `AWS Configuration` navigate to `Rules` and select `Add rule`
      - Select rule type: `Add AWS managed rule`
      - In **AWS Managed Rules** select: `s3-bucker-versioning-enabled`
      - `Next`
      - In second step verify that **Resource cathegory** is configured to track the `AWS S3 Bucket`
      - Navigate to step 3 and create rule

<br>

3. **After the Rule Is Evaluated**
    - Since the rule applicaes to resources created, updated or deleted, we have to manually execute the rule to check resources for compliance.
    - Navigate to `AWS Config` -> `Rules`
    - Select radio button of the rule created and select `Re-evaluate` in the `Actions` drop-down
    - After few minutes you should find that in the **Detective compliance** tab, there are non-compliant resource.
    - Also you can now find the same results in the main dashboard view (i.e. 1 noncompliant rule(s) and 2 noncompliant resource(s))
