# Demo:<br>Implementing Automating Patching Using AWS Systems Manager

![](../img/demo/2.8.SystemsManager-Patching.png)

<br>

1. **Create an IAM Role**<br>We'll attach the policy `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
    - Navigate to `IAM` in AWS console
    - Go to `Access management` -> `Roles`
    - Select `Create role`
      - **Step 1** Select trusted entity:
        - **Trusted entrity type**: `AWS service`
        - **Use case**: `EC2`
        - `Next`
      - **Step 2** Add permissions:
        - Search and add `AmazonSSMManagerInstanceCore` policy
        - `Next`
      - **Step 3** Name, review, and create:
        - **Role name**: `my-ssm-role`
        - **Description**: `Allow EC2 instance to call AWS service on your behalf`
        - `Create role`



<br>

2. **Launch an EC2 Instance**<br>Attach the role we just created
    - Navigate to `EC2` and select `Launch instance`
    - Provide following details:
      - Name: `SSM demo`
      - OS: `AMI2`
      - Instance type: `t3.micro`
      - Key pair: `Proceed without a key pair`
      - Advanced details:
        - IAM instance profile: `my-ssm-role`
    - Launch instance

<br>

3. **Open the System Manager Console**<br>We'll find our instance in the Fleet Manager section
    - Navigate to `Systems Manager`
    - On the left-hand menu navigate to `Node Management` -> `Fleet Manager`
    - If our EC2 instnace has correctly registered with the Fleet Manager it will appear in the list of ***Managed nodes***

<br>

4. **Use Patch Manager**<br>Scan for and install any missing patches
    - In `Systems Manager` service, navigate to `Node Management` -> `Patch Management`

    > `Dashboard view`<br><br>
    > `Compliance summary` provides compliance status for managed instances that have previously reported patch data<br>
    > `Noncompliance count` reports on number of non-compliant instances (i.e. missing patches, failed patches and nodes that need rebooting after applying patches)
    > `Compliance reports` at first time configuring this, it will show one instance that has yet to report compliance status.

    > `Patch baselines`<br><br>
    > A list of all baseline latest securty patches that have a severity level of critical or important, as well as any patches relating to bug fixes.<br>
    > You can filter the list based on the operating system (i.e. `Operating system = Amazon Linux 2023`)

    > `Patches`<br><br>
    > In the following tab you can serach for a group of patches based on OS and one of the following: KB.MSRC, Patch set, Product, Product family, Classification, Severity. For example: `OS: Windows, Classification = SecurityUpdates`

    - To apply patch to our created AMI2 EC2 isntance, navigate to `Patch baselines` tab and serach for OS: Amazon Linux 2023. Select the patch available.
    - On the top-right corner select `Patch now`
      - **Basic configuration**:
        - *Patching operation*: 
          - [x] `Scan and install`
          - [ ] `Scan`
        - *Reboot option*: 
          - [x] `Reboot if needed`
          - [ ] `Do not reboot my instances`
          - [ ] `Schedule a reboot time`
        - *Instances to patch*:
          - [x] `Patch all instances`
          - [ ] `Patch only the target instances I specify`
        - *Patching log storage*
          - By default, it wants to store patching operation logs in S3 and it will select S3 bucket avaiable in your account.
          - For this demo, select option `Do not store logs`
      - **Advanced options**:
        - In this section you can configure lifecycle hooks and these refer to SSM documents or scripts that you can run at certain points during the patching operation.<br>This allow you to orchestrate for complex patching scenarios (i.e. if you need to perform specific actions during the patching process, like stopping a process or stopping an application)
    - Select `Patch now` to initiate patching process.
