### **1. Introduction to Access Troubleshooting Tools**  
- **Goal:** Learn to audit and troubleshoot access issues within AWS.  
- **Key Services Covered:**  
  - AWS CloudTrail  
  - IAM Access Analyzer  
  - IAM Policy Simulator  

<br>

### **2. AWS CloudTrail**  
**Purpose:**  
- Monitors **user activity** and **API usage** within AWS.  
- Provides insights into backend API responses for events like file uploads, IAM changes, or logins.  

**Features:**  
- **Records Events:** Logs all API calls made in the AWS account.  
- **Event History:**  
  - Access the past **two weeks** of events via the console.  
  - Optionally store event logs indefinitely in an **S3 bucket** or **CloudWatch Logs**.  
- **Insights Monitoring:** Detect unusual API activity by enabling **CloudTrail Insights**.  
- **Athena Integration:** Query events using SQL (if integrated).  

**Setup:**  
1. Create a new trail in the CloudTrail console.  
2. Configure an S3 bucket to store logs.  
3. Optionally use **KMS keys** for secure encryption.  

**Use Case Walkthrough:**  
- View event history (e.g., console login):  
  - Shows details such as source IP, event time, MFA usage, and user agent.  
- Configure **CloudWatch alarms** to act upon specific events.

### **3. IAM Access Analyzer**  
**Purpose:**  
- Identifies resources shared with external entities, ensuring secure access configurations.  

**Supported Resources:**  
- **IAM Roles:** Detect roles accessible by other accounts.  
- **S3 Buckets:** Identify public or shared buckets.  
- **Lambda:** Find shared functions and layers.  
- **KMS Keys:** Check for externally accessible keys.  
- **Secrets Manager & SQS:** Highlight shared secrets and queues.  

**Steps to Use Access Analyzer:**  
1. **Create an Analyzer:**  
   - Define a **zone of trust** (current AWS account or others).  
2. **Review Findings:**  
   - Inspect flagged resources for potential security risks.  
3. **Resolve Findings:**  
   - Example: Restrict public access to an S3 bucket by editing permissions and bucket policies.

### **4. IAM Policy Simulator**  
**Purpose:**  
- Simulates IAM policies to test and troubleshoot user, group, or role permissions **without applying them**.  

**Capabilities:**  
- Test existing policies to validate access for resources.  
- Troubleshoot **permission boundaries** and conditions (e.g., IP restrictions, time constraints).  
- Create and test new policies directly in the simulator.  

**Steps to Use:**  
1. Select a user, group, or role for testing.  
2. Choose a service (e.g., API Gateway) and actions to simulate.  
3. View results:  
   - **Allowed** or **Denied** based on policy conditions.  
4. Test custom policies by pasting policy JSON into the simulator.  

**Example Walkthrough:**  
- Simulate API Gateway permissions.  
- Adjust policies in real-time to observe the effect on allowed/denied actions.
