- **Key Services Covered:**  
  - AWS CloudTrail  
  - IAM Access Analyzer  
  - IAM Policy Simulator  

<br>

### **2. AWS CloudTrail**  
**Purpose:**  
- Monitors **user activity** and **API usage** within AWS.  
- Provides insights into backend API responses for events like file uploads, IAM changes, or logins.  

**Features:**  
- **Records Events:** Logs all API calls made in the AWS account.  
- **Event History:**  
  - Access the past **two weeks** of events via the console.  
  - Optionally store event logs indefinitely in an **S3 bucket** or **CloudWatch Logs**.  
- **Insights Monitoring:** Detect unusual API activity by enabling **CloudTrail Insights**.  
- **Athena Integration:** Query events using SQL (if integrated).  

**Setup:**  
1. Create a new trail in the CloudTrail console.  
2. Configure an S3 bucket to store logs.  
3. Optionally use **KMS keys** for secure encryption.  

**Use Case Walkthrough:**  
- View event history (e.g., console login):  
  - Shows details such as source IP, event time, MFA usage, and user agent.  
- Configure **CloudWatch alarms** to act upon specific events.
