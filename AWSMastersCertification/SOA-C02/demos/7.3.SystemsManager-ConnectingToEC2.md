### Objectives
- **Create an IAM Role**<br>Create a role with permissions to communicate with Session Manger and CloudWatch:
  - `AmazonSSManagedInstanceCore`
  - `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy`
- **Launch an EC2 Instance**<br>Associate the instance with the IAM role
- **Configure a CloudWatch Log Group**<br>This will allow us to our sessions
- **Connect to the EC2 Instance**<br>Use Session Manager to connect to the instance and review the session logs

<br><br><br>

## Solution
### **1. Create an IAM Role for Session Manager**
1. **Navigate to IAM**:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and search for **IAM**.
2. **Create a Role**:
   - Select **Roles** > **Create Role**.
   - Choose **AWS Service** as the trusted entity and **EC2** under Common Use Cases.
3. **Attach Policies**:
   - Search and attach the following policies:
     - **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore**: Enables communication between the EC2 instance and Session Manager.
     - **CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy**: Allows EC2 to send logs to CloudWatch.
4. **Finalize Role**:
   - Name the role (e.g., `SSM-CloudWatch-Role`), review attached policies, and create the role.

### **2. Launch an EC2 Instance**
1. **Launch the Instance**:
   - Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** and click **Launch Instance**.
   - Name the instance and select **Amazon Linux AMI** as the OS.
   - Choose instance type: **t3.micro**.
2. **IAM Role**:
   - Under **Advanced Details**, select the IAM role you created earlier.
3. **Network Settings**:
   - Ensure **Auto-assign Public IP** is enabled.
   - Remove the SSH rule from the security group, as SSH is not required.
4. **Key Pair**:
   - Select **Proceed Without a Key Pair** since Session Manager doesnâ€™t require SSH.
5. **Launch**:
   - Launch the instance.
