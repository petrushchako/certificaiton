# Demo:<br>Configuring Encryption on an S3 Bucket


### Objectives
1. **Crete an S3 Bucket**<br>Note that encryption is enabled by default
2. **Review Encryption Options**<br>Review the server-side encryption options that are available
3. **Configure the Use of SSE-KMS Encryption**<br>Configure SSE-KMS as the default encryption type


<br>

## Solution
### **Create an S3 Bucket with SSE-KMS encryption**
 - Navigate to `S3` and select `Create bucket`
 - Name: `<someName>`
 - In **Default encryption** see that default encryption is selected (SSE-S3)
 - Select `AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS)` option. This will require additional configuration.
 - AWS KMS key: `Choose from your AWS KMS keys`
 - Select `Create a KMS key` (This will take you to KMS AWS service)
 - `KMS` > `Customer-managed keys` > `Create key`:
   - **Step 1<br>Configure key**
     - Key type: `Symetric`
     - Key Usage: `Encrypt and decrypt`
     - `Next`
   - **Step 2<br>Add lable**
     - Alias: `mykmskey`
     - `Next`
   - **Step 3<br>Define key administrative permissions**<br>At this point we need to add the name of a key administrator, and this could be a user or role in our account that has permissions to administer the key.
     - Key administrators: `admin`
     - `Next`
   - **Step 4<br>Define key usage permissions**<br>At this point we gonna add a key user, and this is gonna be our cloud_user account.
     - Key user: `cloud_user`
     - `Next`
   - **Step 5<br>Review**
     - Review configuration and press `Finish`
 - Refresh the **Available AWS KMS keys** by pressing refresh button next to **Create a KMS key**
 - Use Available AWS KMS keys dropdown to find previously created key (e.g. `mykmskey`)
 - Complete configuration by selecting `Create bucket`
