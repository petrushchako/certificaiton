## Solution

### Step 1: Create Two S3 Buckets
1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console** and navigate to the **S3** service.
2. **Create the first bucket**:
   - Name it `my-inventory-data`.
   - Configure any region settings as needed, and leave other settings as defaults unless specific requirements apply.
   - **Click “Create bucket”** to finalize.
3. **Create the second bucket**:
   - Name it `my-finance-data`.
   - Again, adjust region or security settings if required.
   - **Click “Create bucket”** to complete the setup.

### Step 2: Upload Files to `my-finance-data`
1. Navigate to the **my-finance-data** bucket in S3.
2. **Upload sample files**:
   - Click on **Upload** and select some files from your local system to simulate data that might be used in a real application.
   - After uploading, confirm the files are now listed within the bucket.

### Step 3: Configure Inventory for `my-finance-data`
1. **Go to the “Management” tab** within the `my-finance-data` bucket and select **Inventory**.
2. **Create a new inventory configuration**:
   - Name the inventory report, e.g., `finance-inventory-report`.
   - **Destination Bucket**: Set the destination as `my-inventory-data` bucket, where the report will be stored.
   - **File Format**: Choose CSV as the file format.
   - **Optional Fields**: Select any additional fields like `Size`, `Last Modified`, and `Storage Class` to include in the report.
3. **Set the Frequency**:
   - Choose a daily or weekly frequency based on how often you want the inventory data updated.
4. **Save the configuration** to enable the inventory process for the `my-finance-data` bucket.

### Step 4: Review the Inventory Report
1. **Wait for Inventory Generation**: The first report may take up to 48 hours to generate.
2. **Check the `my-inventory-data` bucket**: Once available, you’ll find the report in the `my-inventory-data` bucket.
3. **Download and Review the Report**:
   - Open the CSV file to view details like object name, size, and storage class.
   - Use this data to confirm inventory setup, analyze stored objects, and validate configurations.
