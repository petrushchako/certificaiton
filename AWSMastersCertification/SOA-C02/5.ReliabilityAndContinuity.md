## Elasticity and Scalability 101
### What is Elasticity?
- Stretching and retracting your infrastructure based on demand(**Short term**)
- Allow you to **pay as you go**
- Typically used during a short period of time, hours or days

### What is Scalability?
- Building your infrastructure to meet your demands over **longer time**

### AWS Services: ELasticity vs Scalability
||**Elasticity**|**Scalability**|
|---|---|---|
|**EC2**|Configure Auto Scaling to increase and decrease the number of EC2 instance|Increase instance sizes<br>Use Reserved instances|
|**DynamoDB**|Increase/decrease IOPS based on traffic spikes|Unlimited amount of storage|
|**RDS**|Can't scale on demand|Increase instance size<br>Add number of instances|
|**Amazon Aurora**|Autoscale up or down to meet varying demand on the database|Modify the instance type|

## Introducing AWS Auto Scaling
### What is AWS Auto Scaling?
An AWS Service which allows you to configure pland to automatically scale your resources
- Allow you to configure and manage scaling for your resources through a scaling plan
- Uses dynamic and predictive scaling to scale your resources
- Useful for scaling applications across several AWS services


### Understanding Scaling Plans
- **Scaling Plans**<br>A set of directions for scaling your resources.
- **Scaling Strategy** (within scaling plan)<br>Instructs AWS Auto Scaling on how to optimize resources in your scaling plan for availability, cost or both.
- There are two types of scaling available:
    - **Dynamic Scaling**<br>Automatically adjusts in response to resource utilization through target tracking.<br>Example: Elastic Container Service reaches 75% utilization, you can set through dynamic sclaing additional tasks to be kicked off when the service or the application reaches 75% or it's compute resources.
    - **Predictive Scaling**<br>Scales load by analyzing resources' historical load.

### Creating Scaling Plans
- **Cloud Formation Scripting**<br>**Find scalable resources** through existing CloudFormation templates
- **EC2 Auto Scaling Group**<br>**Select one or more** existing EC2 Auto Scaling groups to be included in your scaling plans
- **Tagged Resources**<br>**Search for scalable resources** using the tags applied to them


### Scalable AWS Services
|Service|Description|
|---|---|
|**EC2**|Maintain an Auto Scaling group through launching or terminating instances|
|**DynamoDB**|Enable tables or secondary indexes to increase or decrease read and write capacity|
|**Elastic Container Services**|Adjust ECS services and tasks in response to load variations|
|**Aurora**|Automatically adjust the number of read replicas in the Aurora DB cluster|
