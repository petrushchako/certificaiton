## Elasticity and Scalability 101
### What is Elasticity?
- Stretching and retracting your infrastructure based on demand(**Short term**)
- Allow you to **pay as you go**
- Typically used during a short period of time, hours or days

### What is Scalability?
- Building your infrastructure to meet your demands over **longer time**

### AWS Services: ELasticity vs Scalability
||**Elasticity**|**Scalability**|
|---|---|---|
|**EC2**|Configure Auto Scaling to increase and decrease the number of EC2 instance|Increase instance sizes<br>Use Reserved instances|
|**DynamoDB**|Increase/decrease IOPS based on traffic spikes|Unlimited amount of storage|
|**RDS**|Can't scale on demand|Increase instance size<br>Add number of instances|
|**Amazon Aurora**|Autoscale up or down to meet varying demand on the database|Modify the instance type|
