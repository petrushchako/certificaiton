<br><br>

## S3 101
### What is S3?
- `S3` stands for Simplate Storage Service
- **Object Store**<br>S3 provides secure, durable, highly-scalable object store.
- **Simple**<br>Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface.
- **Scalable**<br>S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web at a very low cost.
- S3 is object-based storage<br>Manages data as objects rather than in file systems or data blocks.
- You can upload any type of file to S3(i.e. photos, videos, code, documents, text files)
- It cannot be used to run operating system or database.

<br>

### S3 Basics
1. **Unlimited Storage**<br>The total volume of data and the number of objects you can store is unlimited
2. **Objects Up to 5 TB in Size**<br>S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes
3. **S3**<br>Store files in buckets (similar to folders)

<br>

### Working with S3 Buckets
1. **Universal Namaspace**<br>All AWS accounts share the same S3 namespace. Each S3 bucket name is globally unique.
2. **Example S3 URLS**:
   - https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name
   - https://fayecloudguru.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Ralphie.jpg
3. **Uploading Files**<br>When you upload a file to an S3 bucket, you receive an HTTP 200 code if the uplaod was successful.

<br>

### S3 Is a Key0Value Data Store
- **Key**<br>The name of the object, for example: `Ralphie.jpg`
- **Value**<br>This is the data itself, which is made up of a sequence of bytes.
- **Version ID**<br>Important for storing multiple versions of the same object.
- **Metadata**<br>Data about data you are storing, e.g. content-type, last-modified, etc
  
<br>

### A Safe Place
- S3 is a safe place to store your files
- The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities to ensure availability and durability
- **Highly Available**<br>is all about the service being available when you need it.<br>Built for 99.5%-99.99% service availability depending on the S3 tier
- **Hihly Durable**<br>is all about your data stored safely and not getting lost or corrupted.<br>Designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability for all data store in S3.

<br>

### S3 Characteristics
- **Tiered Storage**<br>S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases.
- **Lifecycle Management**<br>Define rules to automatically transition objects to cheapter storage tier or delete objects that are no longer required after a set period of time.
- **Versioning**<br>With versioning, all versions of an object are stored and can be retrieved, including deleted objects.

<br>

### Secure Your Data
1. **Server-side Encryption**<br>You can set default encryption on bucket to encrypt all new objects when they are stored in the bucket
2. **Access Control List (ACLs)**<br>Define which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. You can attack S3 ACLs to individual objects within a bucket.
3. **Bucket Policies**<br>S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied (e.g. allow user Alice to PUT but not DELETE objects in the bucket)


<br><br><br>

## Reviewing S3 Storage Classes
### `S3 Standard`
- **High Availability and Durability**<br>Data is stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple dacilities (>=3 AZs)
   - 99.99% Availability
   - 99.999999999% Durability (11 9's)
- **Designed for Frequent Access**<br>Perfect for frequently accessed data
- **Suitable for Most Workloads**
   - The default storage class
   - Use cases include websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics

<br>

### `S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3-IA)`
- **Rapid Access**<br>Used for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed
   - 99.9% Availability
   - 99.999999999% Durability (11 9's)
- **You Pay to Access the Data**<br>There is a low per-GB storage price and a per-GB retrieval fee
- **Use Cases**<br>Great for long-term storage, backups, and disaster recovery files. Minimum storage duration: 30 days

<br>

### `S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access`
- Like `S3-IA`, but data is stored redundantly within a single AZ.
  - 99.5% Availability
  - 99.999999999% (11 9's) Durability
- Cost 20% less than regular S3-IA
- Great for long-lived, infrequently accessed, non-critical data
- Minimum storage duration: 30 days

<br>

### `Glacier` Options
  - Glacier is very cheap storage
  - Optimized for data that is very infrequently accessed
  - You pay each time you access your data
  - Use only for archiving data

1. `Glacier Instant Retrieval`<br>Long-lived data, accessed approximately once per quarter, and needs millisecond retrieval time. 
   - 99.9% Availability
   - 99.999999999% Durability
   - Minimum storage duration: 90 days
2. `Glacier Flexible Retrieval`<br>Long-term data archiving that occasionally needs to be accessed within a few hours or minutes.
   - 99.99% Available
   - 99.999999999% Durable
   - Minimum storage duration: 90 days
3. `Glacier Deep Archive`<br>Long-term archiving for rarely accessed data
   - 99.99% Availability
   - 99.999999999% (11 9's) Durability
   - Default retrieval time **12 hours**
   - Good for financial records that may be accessed once or twice per year.
   Minimum storage duration: 180 days.

<br>

### `S3 Intelligent-Tiering`
- 2 tiers: **frequent** and **infrequent** access
- Automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective tier based on how frequently you access each object.
- Optimized Cost<br>Added monthly fee of $0.0025 per 1000 objects.
- 99.9% Availability
- 99.999999999% (11 9's) Durability


<br>

### Relative Storage Costs

<br><br><br>


## Working with S3 Lifecycle Policies
### What are S3 lifecycle policies?

A cost-effective way to store your files in S3.

- **Save Money**<br>Ensure your files are stored using the most cost-effective S3 option throughout their lifecycle
- **Lifecycle Rules**<br>Use lifecycle rules to tell S3 to transition objects to less expensive storage classes, archive them or delete them
- *Use Case*<br>Great for objects with a well-defined lifecycle, e.g. log files, which may not be useful once they reach a certain age

<br>

### Examples
- Transaction logs<br>Transition log files to an Infrequent Access stoage class 90 days after you create them
- Archive<br>Archive objects to Glacier, or Glacier Deep Archive 1 year after creating them
- Expiry Date<br>Configure objects to expire 1 year after creating them - S3 will auto-delete expired objects on your behalf
- Housekeeping<br>S3 buckets which have Server Access Loggins enabled can accumulate large log files over time. This is where you log all your requests to your S3 buckets. Once logs reach a certain age, you can set an expiry date and delete them for you. 


<br><br><br>

## Protecting Data from Accidental Deletion Using S3 Versioning
### What is S3 Versioning?
With versioning enabled, S3 stores multiple versions of the same object, allowing you to revert to a previous version of an object.

> By dedault it is not enabled

<br>

### How It Works
- Multiple versions of an object are stored in the same bucket
- You can respore every version of every object stored in your bucket
- With versioning enabled, **DELETE** request doesn't delete the object, but applies a delete marker instead.<br>The delete marker becomes the current version of the file
- After deletion you can still access all the previous versions of the file.<br>Specify the version ID in the GET request
- To permanently delete the object, provide the object version ID in the DELETE request.<br>Only the version corresponding to the version ID provided will be deleted, and all other version will remain

<br><br><br>



## Protecting Data from Accidental Deletion Using MFA Delete
### What is MFA Delete?
- An additional layer of protection to S3 versioning (requires versioning to be enabled).
- A physical or virtual MDA device is used to grante an authentication code, which is used to authenticate delete request

<br>

### How It Protects Your Data
- You need a valid code from your MFA device in order to permanently delete an object version or to disable/re-enable versioning. `--mfa "arn:aws:iam::123456789:mfa/root-account-mfa-device 123456"`

<br><br><br>


## S3 Encryption
### Why Encrypt?
- **A Security Best Practice**<br>Protecting data using encryption is a security best practice
- **Data Is an Asset**<br>All businesses store data that should be protected (e.g., financial data, customer data, business plans, proprietory code)
- **Encrypt**<br>Helps protect your data against unauthorized access

<br>

### S3 Encryption Options
1. **Encryption in Transit**
   - SSL/TLS
   - HTTPS
2. **Encryption at Rest: Server-Side Encryption**
    - **SSE-S3** (default) - S3-managed keys, using AWS 256-bit encryption
    - **SSE-KMS** - AWS Key Management Service-managed keys (useful option in case you are required to maintain create and maintain the keys for regulatory purposes)
    - **SSE-C** - Customer-provided keys (similar to SSE-KMS, expect that keys are created outside of AWS)
3. **Encryption at Rest: Client-Side Encryption**
   - You encrypt the files yourself before you upload them into S3.



<br><br><br>



## Introduction to Elastic File System (EFS)
### What is EFS?
1. **Managed Network File System**<br>Highly available and scalable
2. **Standard NFS Protocol**<br>Used by Linux systems. EFS is for Linux-based workloads only
3. **Multiple EC2 Instances Can Access**<br>Multiple instnaces can access the file system at once. Great for applications which need to access shared files, e.g. a shared configuration file or state information.<br>**You cannot do this with EBS**
4. **Kifecycle Management**<br>Any files in your file system that are not accessed for a period of time will automatically move to the EFS Infrequent Access (EFS IA) storage class.
5. **Encryption**<br>You can configure encryption at rest and in transit

<br>

### EFS Example Scenario 
![](img/4.2.EFS-Example.png)

<br>

### Enabling Encryption at Rest
If you enable encryption for your file system, all data on your file system will be encrypted at rest. You can select a KMS key from your account to protect your file system, or you can provide the ARN of a key from a different account.<br>**Encryption of data at rest can only be enabled during file system creation**.<br>Encryption of data in transit is configured when mounting your file system.<br>
If you decide to encrypt your EFS later on, you will have to create new EFS and migrate files.

<br>

## EFS Storage Classes

||Use Case|Durability|Availability|AZs|Considerations|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**EFS Standard**|Frequently accessed data, needs highest availability|11 9's|99.99%|>=3|N/A|
|**EFS Standard-Infrequent Access(IA)**|Infrequently accessed data, needs highest availability|11 9's|99.99%|>=3|Per GB retrieval fees|
|**EFS One Zone**|Frequently accessed data, doesn't require highest availability|11 9's|99.9%|1|Not resilient to the loss of AZ|
|**EFS One Zone-IA**|Infrequent access data, doesn't require highest availability|11 9's|99.9%|1|Not resilient to the loss of AZ Per GB retrieval fees|
