## S3 101
### What is S3?
- `S3` stands for Simplate Storage Service
- **Object Store**<br>S3 provides secure, durable, highly-scalable object store.
- **Simple**<br>Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface.
- **Scalable**<br>S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web at a very low cost.
<br>
- S3 is object-based storage<br>Manages data as objects rather than in file systems or data blocks.
- You can upload any type of file to S3(i.e. photos, videos, code, documents, text files)
- It cannot be used to run operating system or database.

<br>

### S3 Basics
1. **Unlimited Storage**<br>The total volume of data and the number of objects you can store is unlimited
2. **Objects Up to 5 TB in Size**<br>S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes
3. **S3**<br>Store files in buckets (similar to folders)

<br>

### Working with S3 Buckets
1. **Universal Namaspace**<br>All AWS accounts share the same S3 namespace. Each S3 bucket name is globally unique.
2. **Example S3 URLS**:
   - https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name
   - https://fayecloudguru.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Ralphie.jpg
3. **Uploading Files**<br>When you upload a file to an S3 bucket, you receive an HTTP 200 code if the uplaod was successful.

<br>

### S3 Is a Key0Value Data Store
- **Key**<br>The name of the object, for example: `Ralphie.jpg`
- **Value**<br>This is the data itself, which is made up of a sequence of bytes.
- **Version ID**<br>Important for storing multiple versions of the same object.
- **Metadata**<br>Data about data you are storing, e.g. content-type, last-modified, etc
