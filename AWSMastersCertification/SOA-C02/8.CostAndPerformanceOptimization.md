## AWS Cost Explorer and Cost Allocation Tags
### **What are Tags?**
- **Definition**: Key-value pairs attached to AWS resources for easy identification and tracking.
  - Example:
    - **Key**: `CreatedBy`
    - **Value**: `AdminUser`
  - Other use cases:
    - Indicate **cost center**, e.g., `CostCenter: Marketing`.
    - Mark **stack type**, e.g., `Stack: Production` or `Stack: Test`.
- **Purpose**: 
  - Helps organize resources.
  - Provides insight into project, owner, or department allocation.

<br>

### **Cost Allocation Tags**
- **Purpose**: Help track AWS costs at a detailed level.
- **Types**:
  1. **User-Defined Cost Allocation Tags**:
     - Created, defined, and applied manually by the user.
  2. **AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tags**:
     - Automatically created by AWS for supported resources.
- **Activation**:
  - Cost allocation tags must be activated in the **Billing Dashboard** to start tracking.

<br>

### **AWS Cost Explorer**
#### **Features**
- **Purpose**: Visualize, view, and analyze AWS usage and costs.
- **Integration**: Filters costs using tags.

#### **Reporting Capabilities**
1. **Cost and Usage Reports**:
   - Aggregated costs across all AWS services.
2. **Savings Plan Reports**:
   - Utilization and coverage reports for savings plans.
3. **Reservation Reports**:
   - Utilization and coverage reports for reserved resources.

<br>

### **Using Cost Explorer**
#### **Steps to Activate and Use**
1. **Activate Tags**:
   - Navigate to **Billing Dashboard â†’ Cost Allocation Tags**.
   - Select desired tags (user-defined or AWS-generated) and activate them.
2. **Access Cost Explorer**:
   - Search for **Cost Explorer** in the AWS Console.
   - Open **Reports** to create or view reports.
3. **Create Reports**:
   - Choose from:
     - Cost and usage.
     - Savings plans.
     - Reservations.
4. **Customize Reports**:
   - Use parameters to adjust:
     - **Date Range**: Set to hourly, daily, or monthly granularity.
     - **Dimensions**: Group data by region, instance type, tags, etc.
     - **Filters**: Apply filters, including tags, to narrow results.
5. **Analyze Costs**:
   - Identify resource usage and costs by filtering on tags.
   - Example: Track costs by the `CreatedBy` tag for a specific user.

### **Exporting Reports**
- Reports can be downloaded as **CSV files** for offline analysis.

<br>

### **Conclusion**
- Tags and Cost Explorer are essential for cost tracking and optimization.
- Understanding these features helps manage AWS resources and prepares you for the exam.

## Improving Costs with AWS Budgets

### **AWS Budgets Overview**  
- **Purpose**: Enables creation and management of budgets for AWS resources to improve cost efficiency.  
- **Capabilities**:  
  1. **Create and Manage Budgets**: Define budgets for costs, usage, savings plans, and reservations.  
  2. **Granularity**: Filter and refine budgets to understand cost sources.  
  3. **Notifications**: Set alerts via **Simple Notification Service (SNS)** or email.  

<br>

### **Types of Budgets**  
1. **Cost Budget**  
   - Tracks costs against a predefined dollar amount.  
   - Example: Budget $10,000 for monthly AWS usage.  

2. **Usage Budget**  
   - Monitors usage of specific **usage types** or **usage type groups** (e.g., EC2 hours, Lambda seconds).  

3. **Savings Plan Budget**  
   - Tracks utilization and coverage of prepaid compute capacity through savings plans.  

4. **Reservation Budget**  
   - Monitors utilization and coverage of reserved capacity (e.g., EC2 Reserved Instances).  

<br>

### **Budget Filters**  
Filters help refine cost budgets for granularity. Common filters:  
- **Service**: Filter costs for specific services like EC2 or Lambda.  
- **Accounts**: Track costs for linked accounts in the **master account**.  
- **Region**: Analyze costs based on specific AWS regions.  
- **Instance Type**: Filter costs by EC2 instance types.  
- **Usage Type**: Track units of resource consumption (e.g., EC2 hours, Lambda seconds).  
- **Tags**: Use cost categories or custom tags to refine budgets.  
- **API Operation, AZ, and Billing Entity**: Further refine costs by operation or location.  

<br>

### **Usage Types and Groups**  
- **Usage Types**: Units used to measure resource consumption.  
  - Examples:  
    - **EC2**: Hours.  
    - **Lambda**: Seconds.  
    - **CloudWatch**: Requests.  

- **Usage Type Groups**: Combine usage types into broader categories.  
  - Examples:  
    - **EC2**: Running hours.  
    - **DynamoDB**: Provisioned throughput (read/write).  
    - **S3**: Standard storage.  
    - **RDS**: Running hours.  

<br>

### **Savings Plan Budget**  
- **Purpose**: Monitors utilization and coverage of savings plans, which offer discounts on committed usage for services like EC2 and Fargate.  
- **Key Metrics**:  
  1. **Utilization**: Measures underutilized savings plans.  
  2. **Coverage**: Determines the percentage of instance usage covered by savings plans.  

<br>

### **Reservation Budget**  
- **Purpose**: Tracks usage of reserved capacity for services like EC2 Reserved Instances.  
- **Key Metrics**:  
  1. **Utilization**: Measures unused reservations.  
  2. **Coverage**: Measures the percentage of usage covered by reservations.  

<br>

### **Budget Alerts**  
- **Thresholds**: Alerts triggered by actual or forecasted costs.  
  - Types:  
    - **Absolute Value**: Fixed dollar amount.  
    - **Percentage**: Percentage of budgeted amount.  
- **Delivery Methods**:  
  - **Email**.  
  - **SNS Topics**.
