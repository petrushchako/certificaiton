## AWS Cost Explorer and Cost Allocation Tags
### **What are Tags?**
- **Definition**: Key-value pairs attached to AWS resources for easy identification and tracking.
  - Example:
    - **Key**: `CreatedBy`
    - **Value**: `AdminUser`
  - Other use cases:
    - Indicate **cost center**, e.g., `CostCenter: Marketing`.
    - Mark **stack type**, e.g., `Stack: Production` or `Stack: Test`.
- **Purpose**: 
  - Helps organize resources.
  - Provides insight into project, owner, or department allocation.

- **Types**:
  1. **User-Defined Cost Allocation Tags**:
     - Created, defined, and applied manually by the user.
  2. **AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tags**:
     - Automatically created by AWS for supported resources.
- **Activation**:
  - Cost allocation tags must be activated in the **Billing Dashboard** to start tracking.

<br>
