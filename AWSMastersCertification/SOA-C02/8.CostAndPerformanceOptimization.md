## Improving Costs with AWS Budgets

### **AWS Budgets Overview**  
- **Purpose**: Enables creation and management of budgets for AWS resources to improve cost efficiency.  
- **Capabilities**:  
  1. **Create and Manage Budgets**: Define budgets for costs, usage, savings plans, and reservations.  
  2. **Granularity**: Filter and refine budgets to understand cost sources.  
  3. **Notifications**: Set alerts via **Simple Notification Service (SNS)** or email.  

<br>

### **Types of Budgets**  
1. **Cost Budget**  
   - Tracks costs against a predefined dollar amount.  
   - Example: Budget $10,000 for monthly AWS usage.  

2. **Usage Budget**  
   - Monitors usage of specific **usage types** or **usage type groups** (e.g., EC2 hours, Lambda seconds).  

3. **Savings Plan Budget**  
   - Tracks utilization and coverage of prepaid compute capacity through savings plans.  

4. **Reservation Budget**  
   - Monitors utilization and coverage of reserved capacity (e.g., EC2 Reserved Instances).  

<br>

### **Budget Filters**  
Filters help refine cost budgets for granularity. Common filters:  
- **Service**: Filter costs for specific services like EC2 or Lambda.  
- **Accounts**: Track costs for linked accounts in the **master account**.  
- **Region**: Analyze costs based on specific AWS regions.  
- **Instance Type**: Filter costs by EC2 instance types.  
- **Usage Type**: Track units of resource consumption (e.g., EC2 hours, Lambda seconds).  
- **Tags**: Use cost categories or custom tags to refine budgets.  
- **API Operation, AZ, and Billing Entity**: Further refine costs by operation or location.  

<br>

### **Usage Types and Groups**  
- **Usage Types**: Units used to measure resource consumption.  
  - Examples:  
    - **EC2**: Hours.  
    - **Lambda**: Seconds.  
    - **CloudWatch**: Requests.  

- **Usage Type Groups**: Combine usage types into broader categories.  
  - Examples:  
    - **EC2**: Running hours.  
    - **DynamoDB**: Provisioned throughput (read/write).  
    - **S3**: Standard storage.  
    - **RDS**: Running hours.  

<br>

### **Savings Plan Budget**  
- **Purpose**: Monitors utilization and coverage of savings plans, which offer discounts on committed usage for services like EC2 and Fargate.  
- **Key Metrics**:  
  1. **Utilization**: Measures underutilized savings plans.  
  2. **Coverage**: Determines the percentage of instance usage covered by savings plans.  

<br>

### **Reservation Budget**  
- **Purpose**: Tracks usage of reserved capacity for services like EC2 Reserved Instances.  
- **Key Metrics**:  
  1. **Utilization**: Measures unused reservations.  
  2. **Coverage**: Measures the percentage of usage covered by reservations.  

<br>

### **Budget Alerts**  
- **Thresholds**: Alerts triggered by actual or forecasted costs.  
  - Types:  
    - **Absolute Value**: Fixed dollar amount.  
    - **Percentage**: Percentage of budgeted amount.  
- **Delivery Methods**:  
  - **Email**.  
  - **SNS Topics**.  

<br><br><br>


## Reducing Cost through Managed Services
### **What are Managed Services?**  
Managed services are AWS services where:  
1. **AWS manages the infrastructure and software updates**.  
2. Key benefits include:  
   - **Elasticity and scalability**: Adjusts resources automatically.  
   - **Reduced operational overhead**: No need to manage hardware or software.  

#### Examples of Managed Services  
1. **AWS Fargate**: Serverless compute engine for containers.  
   - Works with **ECS** (Elastic Container Service) and **EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service).  
   - No need to provision or manage servers.  
   - Pay-as-you-go for compute resources.  
   - Improves security through application isolation.  

2. **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)**: Scalable, serverless file storage.  
   - Automatically grows or shrinks based on file additions/removals.  
   - Charges only for storage used.  

3. **Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)**: Managed relational databases.  
   - Handles database setup, patching, backups, and scaling.  
   - Includes **Aurora Serverless** and storage auto-scaling options.  

<br>

### **AWS Fargate**  
1. **Cost-saving features**:  
   - No EC2 instances needed for containers.  
   - Pay only for compute used, avoiding overprovisioning.  

2. **Workflow**:  
   - Build container image.  
   - Define compute resources.  
   - Deploy and pay for used compute.  

3. **Comparison with EC2**:  
   - EC2 requires paying for instance size, regardless of usage.  
   - Fargate is serverless and cost-efficient for containers.  

<br>

### **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)**  
1. **High availability and durability**:  
   - Data replicated across 3 Availability Zones.  
   - 99.99% availability within the Region.  

2. **Scalability**:  
   - Automatically adjusts to storage and throughput needs.  

3. **Integration with other services**:  
   - Works with containers, serverless services, Lambda, and EC2.  
   - Supports AWS Backup for automatic backups.  

4. **Storage classes and lifecycle management**:  
   - Classes: **EFS Standard**, **Infrequent Access (IA)**, **One Zone**, **One Zone-IA**.  
   - Files moved between classes based on lifecycle policies.  

<br>

### **Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)**  
1. **Aurora Serverless**:  
   - Auto-scaling relational database.  
   - Scales up/down based on application needs.  

2. **RDS Storage Auto Scaling**:  
   - Automatically grows storage as data increases.  

3. **Reserved Database Instances**:  
   - Purchase compute capacity upfront for cost savings.
