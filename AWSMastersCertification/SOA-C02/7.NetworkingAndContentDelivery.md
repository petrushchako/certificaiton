## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Overview
### VPC Introduction
- Think of VPC as a virtual data center in the cloud
- Logically isolated part of the AWS Cloud where you can define your own network, and install your own resources
- Have complete control of the virtual network including your own IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.

<br>

### Networking
- **Fully Customizable Network**
  - Enables multi-layered security, using network access control lists (network ACLs) and security groups, to control access to the EC2 instances in your subnets.
  - Example 3-tier architecture:
    ![](img/7.1.VPC-3-Tier-Architecture.png)

<br>

### VPNs
- Additionally, you can establish a **hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN)** connection between your own data center and your VPC. This enables you to utilize the Cloud as an extension of your own data center.
- VPN allow you to establish secure, private, encrypted tunnel between your data center and AWS.

<br>

### Network Diagram
- **VPC with Public and Private Subnet(s)

> In example above access to the Private subent is only allowed from VPN connection

<br>

| AWS Recommended Internal CIDR Ranges |
|---|
|10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)|
|172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)|
|192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)|

> Use ![cidr.xyz](https://cidr.xyz) to check your CIRD ranges

<br>

### VPC Features
- **Launch Instances**<br>Launch instances into a subnet of our choosing
- **Custom IP Addresses**<br>Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet
- **Route Tables**<br>Configure route tables between subnets
- **Internet Gateway**<br>Create an internet gateway and attach in to our VPC
- **Control**<br>Control which networks can access our AWS resources
- **Security Mechanisms**<br>Network Access Control Lists. Security Groups.


<br>

### Comparing VPCs
|Default VPC|Custom VPC|
|---|---|
|Default VPC is user friendly|Fully customizable|
|All subnets in default VPC have route out to the internet|You can configure the way you want|
|Each EC2 instance has both public and private IP address|You decide if subnets will be public or private|
||Takes time to set up|


<br><br><br>


## Understanding VPC Peering
### What is VPC Peering?
**VPC Peering** allows you to route traffic between 2 VPCs using private IP address:
    - Enables EC2 instances in one VPC to communicate with instances in another
    - Instances behave as if they were on the same private network
    - The VPCs do not need to be in the same account or AWS Region
> VPCs must have different IP ranges and not have duplicate IP addresses

<br>

### How it Works
![](img/7.2.VPC-Peering.png)
> Connectivity has to be explicitly enables between VPC X and VPC Y, as other VPC cannot be configured as tranceivers

## Securely Connecting to a VPC Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
### **What is a Site-to-Site VPN?**
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A secure connection between on-premises networks, remote offices, client devices, and AWS resources.
- **AWS Site-to-Site VPN**:
  - Creates an encrypted tunnel between your **network** and **VPC**.
  - Uses **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**, an industry-standard protocol for encrypting communications between two devices.
  - Provides secure communication over the **internet**.

#### **Components Required for Configuration**
1. **Virtual Private Gateway (AWS Side)**:
   - Configured within your **VPC**.
   - Acts as the entry point to your VPC for VPN connections.

2. **Customer Gateway Device (On-Premises Side)**:
   - Located in your **data center** or **remote office**.
   - Can be a physical device or a virtual software appliance.
   - Common vendors: Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Juniper, Netgate, etc.
   - Must support the **IPsec protocol**.

<br>

### **Example Use Case**
- **Scenario**: Connecting a corporate data center to an AWS VPC.
1. Deploy a **Virtual Private Gateway** in the VPC.
2. Set up a **Customer Gateway Device** in the data center (physical or virtual).
3. Establish a secure **IPsec tunnel** between the two gateways:
   - Ensures all network packets passing through the tunnel are encrypted.
   - Provides a **secure connection** between the corporate data center and AWS resources.


<br><br><br>

## What is Direct Connect?
#### **What is AWS Direct Connect?**
- A **dedicated private connection** between:
  - Your corporate **data center**.
  - Your **AWS VPC**.
- **Avoids the internet** entirely.
- **Enables** communication with AWS resources like EC2 and RDS without internet dependency.

<br>

#### **Benefits of Direct Connect**
1. **Enterprise-grade solution**:
   - Designed for organizations with high-throughput needs.
2. **Private Connection**:
   - Offers a dedicated link into the AWS network.
3. **Increased Network Throughput**:
   - Speed options: **1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps**.
4. **Consistency**:
   - Reliable and predictable network performance.
   - Eliminates fluctuations seen in internet-based connections.
5. **Improved Stability**:
   - Ideal for workloads experiencing issues like:
     - Slow speeds.
     - Unreliable connections with site-to-site VPNs.

<br>

#### **Direct Connect Architecture**
1. **Core Components**:
   - **VPC**: AWS environment containing resources (EC2, RDS).
   - **Corporate Data Center**: On-premises infrastructure.
   - **Direct Connect Location**: Physical co-location facilities hosting AWS Direct Connect routers.

2. **Direct Connect Locations**:
   - Facilities where AWS has a presence.
   - Examples of co-location providers:
     - **Equinix**, **Cologix**, **CoreSite**, etc.
   - Full list: [AWS Direct Connect Locations](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/locations).

3. **Setup Requirements**:
   - **Customer Router**:
     - Installed in the same Direct Connect location as the AWS router.
     - Communicates directly with AWS Direct Connect routers.
   - **Network Link**:
     - Connection between your data center and the Direct Connect router.
     - **Delivery Partners**:
       - Providers like Colt, BT, Equinix, Telstra, or Zayo.
       - Full list: [AWS Direct Connect Delivery Partners](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/partners/).

4. **Setup Timeline**:
   - Provisioning often takes **weeks**, not days.
   - Engage third-party partners for smooth setup.
