## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Overview
### VPC Introduction
- Think of VPC as a virtual data center in the cloud
- Logically isolated part of the AWS Cloud where you can define your own network, and install your own resources
- Have complete control of the virtual network including your own IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.

<br>

### Networking
- **Fully Customizable Network**
  - Enables multi-layered security, using network access control lists (network ACLs) and security groups, to control access to the EC2 instances in your subnets.
  - Example 3-tier architecture:

<br>

### VPNs
- Additionally, you can establish a **hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN)** connection between your own data center and your VPC. This enables you to utilize the Cloud as an extension of your own data center.
- VPN allow you to establish secure, private, encrypted tunnel between your data center and AWS.

> In example above access to the Private subent is only allowed from VPN connection

| AWS Recommended Internal CIDR Ranges |
|---|
|10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)|
|172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)|
|192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)|

> Use ![cidr.xyz](https://cidr.xyz) to check your CIRD ranges

<br>

### VPC Features
- **Launch Instances**<br>Launch instances into a subnet of our choosing
- **Custom IP Addresses**<br>Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet
- **Route Tables**<br>Configure route tables between subnets
- **Internet Gateway**<br>Create an internet gateway and attach in to our VPC
- **Control**<br>Control which networks can access our AWS resources
- **Security Mechanisms**<br>Network Access Control Lists. Security Groups.


<br>

### Comparing VPCs
|Default VPC|Custom VPC|
|---|---|
|Default VPC is user friendly|Fully customizable|
|All subnets in default VPC have route out to the internet|You can configure the way you want|
|Each EC2 instance has both public and private IP address|You decide if subnets will be public or private|
||Takes time to set up|
