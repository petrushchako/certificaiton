## Compliance on AWS
### Compliance on AWS
   - **Compliance on AWS** is a set of controls, standards, and frameworks designed to help customers meet security and compliance requirements.
   - Key components:
     - **Shared Responsibility Model**: AWS manages infrastructure security, while customers are responsible for securing their applications and data.
     - **Compliance Frameworks**: AWS is certified under several frameworks, but additional application-specific compliance may be needed.

<br>

### Compliance Frameworks Overview
   - **ISO 27001**: 
     - Developed by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission.
     - Requires third-party audits to verify a systemâ€™s compliance.
     - AWS is certified, but systems built on AWS must be audited separately.
   - **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**:
     - Ensures the confidentiality and security of healthcare information.
     - Essential for applications handling patient data.
   - **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**:
     - Focuses on securing credit and debit card transactions.
     - Key for e-commerce businesses accepting online payments.

### PCI DSS Compliance Requirements (v3.2)
   - **12 Requirements**:
     1. **Firewall**<br>Install firewall configurations to protect cardholder data.
     2. **Password Protection**<br>Avoid default passwords for system security.
     3. **Protect data**<br>Secure stored cardholder data (at rest).
     4. **Encrypt transmission**<br>Encrypt transmission of cardholder data over public networks.
     5. **Update antivirus**<br>Regularly update anti-virus software.
     6. **Develop and maintain**<br>Develop secure applications and systems.
     7. **Restrict access**<br>Restrict access to data on a need-to-know basis.
     8. **Unique identifiers**<br>Assign unique IDs for each user with system access.
     9. **Physical data protection**<br>Limit physical access to cardholder data.
     10. **Track and monitor**<br>Monitor and log access to network resources (CloudTrail and CloudWatch).
     11. **Regular security testing**<br>Regularly test security systems.
     12. **Maintain security policy**<br>Maintain a security policy for personnel.

<br>

### Other Notable Compliance Frameworks
   - **FIPS 140-2**: US standard for cryptographic security, with AWS CloudHSM meeting level 3.
   - **SOC1, SAS70, and FISMA**: Various standards focused on financial, audit, and government data security.

<br>

### FedRAMP on AWS
   - **FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)**:
     - Federal compliance framework for cloud service security, designed to support US government agencies.
     - **AWS GovCloud**: A FedRAMP-certified AWS region tailored for government compliance and data protection.

<br><br><br>

## Understanding Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

> ![AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency.pdf)

### What is a DDoS Attack?
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: An attack aimed at making a website or application unavailable to end-users by overwhelming it with traffic.
- Achieved through methods like:
  - **Packet floods**: High volume of packets to overload the system.
  - **Botnets**: Large networks of compromised devices used to flood the target.

<br>

### Amplification/Reflection Attacks
- **Amplification and Reflection**: Attacker sends a spoofed request (appearing as the victim's IP) to a third-party server.
- Common attack methods:
  - **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**: Attackers use spoofed IP addresses to get amplified responses.
  - **SSDP, DNS, Chargen, SNMP**: Other services that can amplify requests.

#### NTP Amplification Attack Example
- **Hacker's IP**: 190.1.2.3
- **Victim's IP**: 245.1.2.3 (used as a spoofed source)
- Hacker sends 64 bytes to the NTP server, which returns 3,456 bytes to the victim, overloading the victim's system.

![](img/6.1.DDoS-example-1.png)

<br>

### Application Layer (Layer 7) Attacks
- **Layer 7 Attack**: Overloads a web server by sending floods of GET requests, causing a slowdown or denial of service.
- **Slowloris Attack**: Attacker opens multiple connections but never completes requests, filling the server's connection limit and preventing access to legitimate users.

<br>

### Mitigating DDoS Attacks on AWS
#### Five Key Mitigation Steps
1. **Minimize Attack Surface Area**:
   - Use AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to monitor and create rules for web traffic.
2. **Scale to Absorb the Attack**:
   - Use auto-scaling groups and plans to ensure sufficient resources are available.
3. **Safeguard Exposed Resources**:
   - Implement additional AWS security services to protect resources.
4. **Monitor Application Behavior**:
   - Learn normal behavior patterns to identify abnormal (attack) patterns.
5. **Plan for Abnormal Behavior**:
   - Create a response plan based on detected anomalies.

### AWS Services for DDoS Mitigation
- **Amazon Shield**: Provides DDoS protection on Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, and Route 53.
- **Amazon Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Pairs with Shield to monitor and filter unwanted traffic.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Offers visibility into accounts and resources through alerts and metrics.

### AWS Shield Levels
- **AWS Shield Standard**: Protects all AWS customers on ELB, CloudFront, and Route 53 against basic DDoS attacks like SYN/UDP floods, reflection attacks and other layer 3/4 attacks
- **AWS Shield Advanced**: 
  - Enhanced protection for applications on ELB, CloudFront, and Route 53.
  - Provides additional support against larger and more sophisticated attacks.
  - Costs $3,000 per month but includes extended support.

## IAM Refresh
### Overview
- **Objective**: A high-level review of Identity and Access Management (IAM) fundamentals for those familiar with AWS basics.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM) Basics
- **Purpose of IAM**: Manages users and access levels within AWS.
  - **Analogy**: Similar to receiving a hotel key with permissions for specific amenities.
- **Centralized Management**: IAM centralizes control over AWS account access and permissions.
- **Shared Access**: Provides the ability to manage and share access across an AWS account.
- **Granular Permissions**: Allows for detailed control over which AWS services and specific functions users can access.
- **Identity Federation**: Supports integration with identity providers like Active Directory, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

### Core Features
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**<br>Provides increased security for your AWS account settings and resources
- **Temporary Access**<br>Provides temporary access for users/devices and services, as necessary
- **Password Policies**<br>Allows you to set up your own password rotation policy
- **Integration**<br>Integrates with many different AWS services
- **Compliance**<br>Supports PCI DSS compliance

### Users, Groups, and Roles
- **Users**: Represents end users or individuals who need AWS account access.
- **Groups**: Collections of users with a shared set of permissions.
- **Roles**: Assignable to users, applications, and services for accessing AWS resources.

### IAM Policy
- **Definition**: A document specifying one or more permissions.
- **Attachment**: Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
- **Resource Policies**: Policies attached directly to resources.


<br><br><br>



## Introducing IAM Identity Center
### **Federated Identity**  
- **Definition:** Federated identity allows users to authenticate once and access multiple systems/applications with a single set of credentials.  
- **Example:**  
  - Instead of managing separate usernames/passwords for email, social media, and banking accounts, services like Google Single Sign-On (SSO) enable access to all accounts with a single identity.  
  - Simplifies login processes across platforms.  

<br>

### **What is IAM Identity Center?**  
- **Purpose:** IAM Identity Center manages identity federation within AWS, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) for multiple AWS accounts and cloud applications.  
  - **Integrates with AWS Organizations**<br>Streamline access and permissions across Organizational Units, AWS accounts and other AWS API operations.
  - **Simplifies Application Sign-On**<br>Easily manage sign-on to multiple AWS accounts, and custom SAML 2.0 applications.
  - **Leverages Existing Active Directories**<br>User your existing corporate Active Directory Service and credentials.
  - **Streamlines User and Group Creation**<br>Create and manage user groups within the console by provisioning external identities.

> Previously known as **AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)**.  

<br>

### **How IAM Identity Center Works**  
**Steps to Enable IAM Identity Center:**  
1. **Enable Identity Center:** Activate it within **AWS Organizations**.  
2. **Select Identity Source:**  
   - AWS Managed Active Directory.  
   - On-premises Active Directory (e.g., Microsoft AD).  
3. **Centrally Manage Permissions:**  
   - Centralized control for user access to AWS accounts and SAML apps.  
4. **Single-Click User Access:**  
   - Users get unified login access to multiple AWS accounts and applications via the console.  

<br>

### **Use Cases**  

![](img/6.3.Identity-Service-SSO.png)

1. **AWS Account Management:**  
   - Streamline user permissions for accessing AWS console resources across accounts managed by **AWS Organizations**.  

2. **Cloud Applications:**  
   - Single-click SSO access for third-party apps like Dropbox, Slack, Jenkins, Atlassian tools, and Office 365.  

3. **Custom SAML Applications:**  
   - Enable SSO for custom-built applications hosted on AWS (e.g., EC2, Elastic Beanstalk).  

4. **Active Directory Integration:**  
   - Use existing **on-premises Active Directory** with AWS via:  
     - **AD Connector:** Connects on-premises AD to AWS.  
     - **AD Trust Relationship:** Establishes trust between on-premises AD and **AWS Directory Service** in your account.  


<br><br><br>

## AWS Inspector vs Truested Advisor

<br><br><br>


## Service Control Policies
### **Introduction**
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs):** Policies in AWS Organizations that help manage access to AWS services across accounts.
- **Key Features:**
  - Grant and deny access to AWS services.
  - Operate through **allow lists** or **deny lists**.
  - Inherit permission boundaries across accounts.

<br>

### **Purpose of SCPs**
- SCPs are used to control which AWS services and actions are accessible within AWS accounts.
- They can:
  - Block access to unnecessary services to optimize security and cost.
  - Enable specific services required for account functionality.

<br>

### **SCP Strategies**
1. **Deny List (Default Strategy):**
   - All services and actions are allowed by default.
   - Explicitly specify which services or actions are denied.
   - Example use case: Blocking access to DynamoDB while allowing all other services.

2. **Allow List:**
   - All services and actions are denied by default.
   - Explicitly specify which services and actions are allowed.
   - Example use case: Allowing only ECS and CloudWatch access.

<br>

### **Example Use Cases**
- **Production Workload Organizational Unit (OU):**
  - Enable VPN along with necessary monitoring services.
- **Development Workload OU:**
  - Disable machine learning services to control costs.
- **Security OU:**
  - Block compute resources to focus on security reporting.

<br>

### **Allow vs Deny Lists (JSON Examples)**

- **Allow List JSON Example:**
  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": ["ecs:*", "cloudwatch:*"],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
  - Grants access to ECS and CloudWatch for all resources.
  - All other services are denied.

- **Deny List JSON Example:**
  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "*",
              "Resource": "*"
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Deny",
              "Action": ["dynamodb:*"],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
  - Allows access to all services except DynamoDB.

<br>

### **Inheritance of SCPs**
- SCPs cascade through the hierarchy of OUs and accounts:
  - A parent OU's SCP applies to all child OUs and accounts.
  - SCPs in child OUs are restricted by the parent SCP.
  - **Example:**
    - Parent SCP: Allows Machine Learning, CloudTrail, and EC2.
    - Child SCP: Allows EC2, Aurora, and EFS.
    - Result: Only EC2 access is granted due to restrictions inherited from the parent SCP.

## Securing Mutiple Accounts with AWS Control Tower and Organizations

## Securing Multiple Accounts with AWS Control Tower and Organziations
### **What is AWS Control Tower?**
AWS Control Tower is a service that allows you to:  
- **Create, configure, and manage multiple AWS accounts securely**.  
- Automate **policy management** and apply **guardrails**.  
- Leverage **AWS Organizations** to create accounts, consolidate billing, and enforce policies.

<br>

### **Why Use a Multi-Account Framework?**
1. **Team Segmentation**: Isolates resources based on team responsibilities.  
2. **Service Limits**: Ensures each application or team has sufficient resource allocation.  
3. **Billing Separation**: Simplifies tracking costs for teams or business units.  
4. **Environment Isolation**: Differentiates production, QA, and development environments.  
5. **Enhanced Security**: Enforces data isolation and applies security controls.  

<br>

### **Key Terminology**

   A framework for:  
   - Building a multi-account structure.  
   - Configuring default accounts, network, and security.  
   - Managing account creation and future configurations.  

2. **Account Factory**:<br>An account template which helps provision new accounts with pre- approved standardized account configurations.
   A standardized account template for:  
   - **Provisioning and managing accounts.**  
   - Automating IAM roles.  
   - Configuring VPCs and using Service Catalog.  

3. **Guardrails**:<br>Rules which provide governance within your AWS environment. Guardrails are applied to Organizational Units (OU) and the accounts within them.
   Pre-configured governance rules for security and compliance.  
   - Applied to **Organizational Units (OUs)** and their accounts.  

<br>

### **Landing Zones Features**
1. **Multi-Account Creation**: Built using **AWS Organizations**.  
2. **Identity Management**: Federated access via **AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)**.  
3. **Consolidated Logging**: Centralized logs using **CloudTrail** and **Config** stored in S3.

- **Master Account**:  
   Houses the AWS service catalog and Organizations structure.  

- **Core Accounts**:  
   1. **Shared Service Account**: Contains default VPC and network baselines.  
   2. **Log Account**: Aggregates logs from all accounts via CloudTrail and Config.  
   3. **Security Account**: Manages cross-account roles, security notifications, and services like GuardDuty.  

<br>

### **Guardrails in AWS Control Tower**
1. **Preventative Guardrails**:  
   - Enforced via **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** or **CloudFormation**.  
   - Prevent policy violations by blocking specific actions (e.g., blocking AI services).  

2. **Detective Guardrails**:  
   - Monitored via **AWS Config Rules**.  
   - Identify and alert about policy violations (e.g., compliance checks).  
   - Displayed in the AWS Control Tower dashboard.  

<br><br><br>


## AWS Organziations vs Control Tower
Both **AWS Organizations** and **AWS Control Tower** are used for managing multiple AWS accounts, but they serve different purposes and provide varying levels of control and automation. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison to help you understand when to use **Control Tower** and what it offers over **Organizations**.

<br>

### **AWS Organizations**
- **Purpose**: A foundational service for managing multiple AWS accounts under a single structure.
- **Key Features**:
  1. **Account Management**: Create and group accounts into **Organizational Units (OUs)**.
  2. **Consolidated Billing**: Manage billing for all accounts centrally.
  3. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Apply policies to control which services and actions can be used in specific accounts or OUs.
  4. **Delegated Administration**: Delegate certain administrative tasks to specific accounts.
- **Use Case**: When you only need **basic account structure, billing management**, and **permissions control**, AWS Organizations is sufficient.

<br>

### **AWS Control Tower**
- **Purpose**: A higher-level service built on top of AWS Organizations, providing **turnkey automation, best practices, and governance** for multi-account management.
- **Key Features**:
  1. **Landing Zone Setup**: Automatically sets up a secure and compliant multi-account environment.
  2. **Account Factory**: Simplifies provisioning of new accounts with pre-configured settings and guardrails.
  3. **Guardrails**: Predefined, best-practice policies for security and compliance (implemented via SCPs and AWS Config rules).
  4. **Monitoring and Auditing**: Automatically configures logging and monitoring through AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config.
  5. **Integration with Other Services**: Includes default configurations for services like AWS Single Sign-On (SSO), centralized logging, and security.
- **Use Case**: When you need a **streamlined, automated setup and governance** for multi-account management and want to enforce AWS best practices without extensive manual configuration.

<br>

### **Why Use Control Tower Over Organizations?**
Think of **Control Tower** as an **enhanced and automated version** of AWS Organizations that adds:
1. **Ease of Setup**: 
   - Organizations alone requires you to manually create OUs, configure SCPs, set up logging, and ensure compliance.
   - Control Tower automates this setup with **Landing Zones** and pre-applied best practices.
2. **Governance at Scale**:
   - Control Tower enforces guardrails automatically and ensures accounts comply with organizational standards.
3. **Consistency**:
   - Every new account provisioned through Control Tower's **Account Factory** adheres to the same baseline configuration.
4. **Integrated Security and Logging**:
   - Control Tower automatically provisions centralized logging and monitoring accounts.

<br>

### When to Use Each?
#### Use **AWS Organizations**:
- If you want full control and are comfortable setting up and managing your environment manually.
- If you have **custom requirements** or a more advanced multi-account setup beyond what Control Tower supports.

#### Use **AWS Control Tower**:
- If youâ€™re looking for a **turnkey solution** to manage and secure your multi-account strategy.
- If your organization values **automation**, **standardization**, and **best practices** out of the box.
- If youâ€™re starting fresh or migrating to a modern multi-account framework and want to do so efficiently.

<br>

### **Analogy**
- **AWS Organizations** is like building a car from parts. You have full control over every component, but it takes effort and expertise.
- **AWS Control Tower** is like buying a pre-built car with safety features, navigation, and controls already installedâ€”itâ€™s ready to drive with minimal setup.

Both are powerful, but the choice depends on your organization's **needs for automation, governance, and customization**.

<br><br><br>


## Security Token Service (STS)
### **What is AWS STS?**
AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a service that provides **temporary, short-lived security credentials** (tokens) for users or applications to access AWS resources securely. These credentials consist of:
1. **Access Key ID**
2. **Secret Access Key**
3. **Session Token**

These credentials are valid for a specific duration (1 minute to 36 hours) and expire automatically after use, reducing the risk of long-term exposure.

<br>

### **Key Use Cases for STS**
1. **Identity Federation**:
   - Integrate external identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, SAML, or custom brokers) with AWS.
   - Example: Employees log in to an enterprise app using their organization credentials and gain temporary AWS access.

2. **Web Identity Federation**:
   - Users can log into applications via third-party identity providers like **Google**, **Facebook**, or **Amazon Login**.
   - Example: A mobile app allows users to authenticate using their Google account, and STS generates temporary credentials for AWS access.

3. **Cross-Account Access**:
   - Allow users in **Account A** to access resources in **Account B** securely without sharing permanent credentials.
   - Example: A developer in one account assumes a role to perform operations in another account.

4. **EC2 Role-Based Access**:
   - Applications running on EC2 instances assume **IAM roles** to access other AWS services securely without hardcoding credentials.
   - Example: A Lambda function uses STS to access an S3 bucket.

<br>

### **Key Concepts in STS**
1. **Federation**:
   - Combines multiple identity domains (e.g., Active Directory with IAM) to enable seamless user access across systems.
   - Example: Single Sign-On (SSO) using Google or Facebook accounts.

2. **Identity Broker**:
   - A service that connects two identity systems, allowing users to authenticate and gain AWS access.
   - Example: An organization's identity broker validates credentials against its LDAP directory and issues temporary AWS credentials.

3. **Identity Store**:
   - A repository of user identities, such as Active Directory, Facebook, or Google.

4. **Temporary Security Credentials**:
   - The core output of STS. These include an **access key**, **secret access key**, and **session token**, with a predefined duration.

<br>

### **How Does STS Work? (Use Case Walkthrough)**
1. **Authentication**:
   - A user logs into an application (e.g., reporting app) with their credentials.
2. **Validation**:
   - The application sends the credentials to an **Identity Broker**.
   - The broker validates the credentials using an LDAP directory or equivalent system.
3. **Token Request**:
   - The broker uses its **IAM credentials** to request a temporary security token from STS.
   - The request includes:
     - Duration of the token (e.g., 12 hours).
     - Permissions policy for the token.
4. **Token Issuance**:
   - STS validates the request and returns:
     - Access Key
     - Secret Access Key
     - Session Token
     - Token Duration
5. **Resource Access**:
   - The application uses the token to access AWS resources (e.g., an S3 bucket).
   - AWS verifies the token and its permissions before granting access.
