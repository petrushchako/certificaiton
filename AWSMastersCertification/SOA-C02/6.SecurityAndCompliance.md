## Compliance on AWS
### Compliance on AWS
   - **Compliance on AWS** is a set of controls, standards, and frameworks designed to help customers meet security and compliance requirements.
   - Key components:
     - **Shared Responsibility Model**: AWS manages infrastructure security, while customers are responsible for securing their applications and data.
     - **Compliance Frameworks**: AWS is certified under several frameworks, but additional application-specific compliance may be needed.

<br>

### Compliance Frameworks Overview
   - **ISO 27001**: 
     - Developed by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission.
     - Requires third-party audits to verify a systemâ€™s compliance.
     - AWS is certified, but systems built on AWS must be audited separately.
   - **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**:
     - Ensures the confidentiality and security of healthcare information.
     - Essential for applications handling patient data.
   - **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**:
     - Focuses on securing credit and debit card transactions.
     - Key for e-commerce businesses accepting online payments.

### PCI DSS Compliance Requirements (v3.2)
   - **12 Requirements**:
     1. **Firewall**<br>Install firewall configurations to protect cardholder data.
     2. **Password Protection**<br>Avoid default passwords for system security.
     3. **Protect data**<br>Secure stored cardholder data (at rest).
     4. **Encrypt transmission**<br>Encrypt transmission of cardholder data over public networks.
     5. **Update antivirus**<br>Regularly update anti-virus software.
     6. **Develop and maintain**<br>Develop secure applications and systems.
     7. **Restrict access**<br>Restrict access to data on a need-to-know basis.
     8. **Unique identifiers**<br>Assign unique IDs for each user with system access.
     9. **Physical data protection**<br>Limit physical access to cardholder data.
     10. **Track and monitor**<br>Monitor and log access to network resources (CloudTrail and CloudWatch).
     11. **Regular security testing**<br>Regularly test security systems.
     12. **Maintain security policy**<br>Maintain a security policy for personnel.

<br>

### Other Notable Compliance Frameworks
   - **FIPS 140-2**: US standard for cryptographic security, with AWS CloudHSM meeting level 3.
   - **SOC1, SAS70, and FISMA**: Various standards focused on financial, audit, and government data security.

<br>

### FedRAMP on AWS
   - **FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)**:
     - Federal compliance framework for cloud service security, designed to support US government agencies.
     - **AWS GovCloud**: A FedRAMP-certified AWS region tailored for government compliance and data protection.

<br><br><br>

## Understanding Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

> ![AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency.pdf)

### What is a DDoS Attack?
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: An attack aimed at making a website or application unavailable to end-users by overwhelming it with traffic.
- Achieved through methods like:
  - **Packet floods**: High volume of packets to overload the system.
  - **Botnets**: Large networks of compromised devices used to flood the target.

<br>

### Amplification/Reflection Attacks
- **Amplification and Reflection**: Attacker sends a spoofed request (appearing as the victim's IP) to a third-party server.
- Common attack methods:
  - **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**: Attackers use spoofed IP addresses to get amplified responses.
  - **SSDP, DNS, Chargen, SNMP**: Other services that can amplify requests.

#### NTP Amplification Attack Example
- **Hacker's IP**: 190.1.2.3
- **Victim's IP**: 245.1.2.3 (used as a spoofed source)
- Hacker sends 64 bytes to the NTP server, which returns 3,456 bytes to the victim, overloading the victim's system.

![](img/6.1.DDoS-example-1.png)

<br>

### Application Layer (Layer 7) Attacks
- **Layer 7 Attack**: Overloads a web server by sending floods of GET requests, causing a slowdown or denial of service.
- **Slowloris Attack**: Attacker opens multiple connections but never completes requests, filling the server's connection limit and preventing access to legitimate users.

<br>

### Mitigating DDoS Attacks on AWS
#### Five Key Mitigation Steps
1. **Minimize Attack Surface Area**:
   - Use AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to monitor and create rules for web traffic.
2. **Scale to Absorb the Attack**:
   - Use auto-scaling groups and plans to ensure sufficient resources are available.
3. **Safeguard Exposed Resources**:
   - Implement additional AWS security services to protect resources.
4. **Monitor Application Behavior**:
   - Learn normal behavior patterns to identify abnormal (attack) patterns.
5. **Plan for Abnormal Behavior**:
   - Create a response plan based on detected anomalies.

### AWS Services for DDoS Mitigation
- **Amazon Shield**: Provides DDoS protection on Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, and Route 53.
- **Amazon Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Pairs with Shield to monitor and filter unwanted traffic.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Offers visibility into accounts and resources through alerts and metrics.

### AWS Shield Levels
- **AWS Shield Standard**: Protects all AWS customers on ELB, CloudFront, and Route 53 against basic DDoS attacks like SYN/UDP floods, reflection attacks and other layer 3/4 attacks
- **AWS Shield Advanced**: 
  - Enhanced protection for applications on ELB, CloudFront, and Route 53.
  - Provides additional support against larger and more sophisticated attacks.
  - Costs $3,000 per month but includes extended support.

## IAM Refresh
### Overview
- **Objective**: A high-level review of Identity and Access Management (IAM) fundamentals for those familiar with AWS basics.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM) Basics
- **Purpose of IAM**: Manages users and access levels within AWS.
  - **Analogy**: Similar to receiving a hotel key with permissions for specific amenities.
- **Centralized Management**: IAM centralizes control over AWS account access and permissions.
- **Shared Access**: Provides the ability to manage and share access across an AWS account.
- **Granular Permissions**: Allows for detailed control over which AWS services and specific functions users can access.
- **Identity Federation**: Supports integration with identity providers like Active Directory, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

### Core Features
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**<br>Provides increased security for your AWS account settings and resources
- **Temporary Access**<br>Provides temporary access for users/devices and services, as necessary
- **Password Policies**<br>Allows you to set up your own password rotation policy
- **Integration**<br>Integrates with many different AWS services
- **Compliance**<br>Supports PCI DSS compliance

### Users, Groups, and Roles
- **Users**: Represents end users or individuals who need AWS account access.
- **Groups**: Collections of users with a shared set of permissions.
- **Roles**: Assignable to users, applications, and services for accessing AWS resources.

### IAM Policy
- **Definition**: A document specifying one or more permissions.
- **Attachment**: Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
- **Resource Policies**: Policies attached directly to resources.


<br><br><br>



## Introducing IAM Identity Center
### **Federated Identity**  
- **Definition:** Federated identity allows users to authenticate once and access multiple systems/applications with a single set of credentials.  
- **Example:**  
  - Instead of managing separate usernames/passwords for email, social media, and banking accounts, services like Google Single Sign-On (SSO) enable access to all accounts with a single identity.  
  - Simplifies login processes across platforms.  

<br>

### **What is IAM Identity Center?**  
- **Purpose:** IAM Identity Center manages identity federation within AWS, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) for multiple AWS accounts and cloud applications.  
  - **Integrates with AWS Organizations**<br>Streamline access and permissions across Organizational Units, AWS accounts and other AWS API operations.
  - **Simplifies Application Sign-On**<br>Easily manage sign-on to multiple AWS accounts, and custom SAML 2.0 applications.
  - **Leverages Existing Active Directories**<br>User your existing corporate Active Directory Service and credentials.
  - **Streamlines User and Group Creation**<br>Create and manage user groups within the console by provisioning external identities.

> Previously known as **AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)**.  

<br>

### **How IAM Identity Center Works**  
**Steps to Enable IAM Identity Center:**  
1. **Enable Identity Center:** Activate it within **AWS Organizations**.  
2. **Select Identity Source:**  
   - AWS Managed Active Directory.  
   - On-premises Active Directory (e.g., Microsoft AD).  
3. **Centrally Manage Permissions:**  
   - Centralized control for user access to AWS accounts and SAML apps.  
4. **Single-Click User Access:**  
   - Users get unified login access to multiple AWS accounts and applications via the console.  

<br>

### **Use Cases**  

![](img/6.3.Identity-Service-SSO.png)

1. **AWS Account Management:**  
   - Streamline user permissions for accessing AWS console resources across accounts managed by **AWS Organizations**.  

2. **Cloud Applications:**  
   - Single-click SSO access for third-party apps like Dropbox, Slack, Jenkins, Atlassian tools, and Office 365.  

3. **Custom SAML Applications:**  
   - Enable SSO for custom-built applications hosted on AWS (e.g., EC2, Elastic Beanstalk).  

4. **Active Directory Integration:**  
   - Use existing **on-premises Active Directory** with AWS via:  
     - **AD Connector:** Connects on-premises AD to AWS.  
     - **AD Trust Relationship:** Establishes trust between on-premises AD and **AWS Directory Service** in your account.  


<br><br><br>

## AWS Inspector vs Truested Advisor

## Service Control Policies
### **Introduction**
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs):** Policies in AWS Organizations that help manage access to AWS services across accounts.
- **Key Features:**
  - Grant and deny access to AWS services.
  - Operate through **allow lists** or **deny lists**.
  - Inherit permission boundaries across accounts.

<br>

### **Purpose of SCPs**
- SCPs are used to control which AWS services and actions are accessible within AWS accounts.
- They can:
  - Block access to unnecessary services to optimize security and cost.
  - Enable specific services required for account functionality.

<br>

### **SCP Strategies**
1. **Deny List (Default Strategy):**
   - All services and actions are allowed by default.
   - Explicitly specify which services or actions are denied.
   - Example use case: Blocking access to DynamoDB while allowing all other services.

2. **Allow List:**
   - All services and actions are denied by default.
   - Explicitly specify which services and actions are allowed.
   - Example use case: Allowing only ECS and CloudWatch access.

<br>

### **Example Use Cases**
- **Production Workload Organizational Unit (OU):**
  - Enable VPN along with necessary monitoring services.
- **Development Workload OU:**
  - Disable machine learning services to control costs.
- **Security OU:**
  - Block compute resources to focus on security reporting.

<br>

### **Allow vs Deny Lists (JSON Examples)**

- **Allow List JSON Example:**
  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": ["ecs:*", "cloudwatch:*"],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
  - Grants access to ECS and CloudWatch for all resources.
  - All other services are denied.

- **Deny List JSON Example:**
  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "*",
              "Resource": "*"
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Deny",
              "Action": ["dynamodb:*"],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
  - Allows access to all services except DynamoDB.

<br>

### **Inheritance of SCPs**
- SCPs cascade through the hierarchy of OUs and accounts:
  - A parent OU's SCP applies to all child OUs and accounts.
  - SCPs in child OUs are restricted by the parent SCP.
  - **Example:**
    - Parent SCP: Allows Machine Learning, CloudTrail, and EC2.
    - Child SCP: Allows EC2, Aurora, and EFS.
    - Result: Only EC2 access is granted due to restrictions inherited from the parent SCP.
