## Compliance on AWS
### Compliance on AWS
   - **Compliance on AWS** is a set of controls, standards, and frameworks designed to help customers meet security and compliance requirements.
   - Key components:
     - **Shared Responsibility Model**: AWS manages infrastructure security, while customers are responsible for securing their applications and data.
     - **Compliance Frameworks**: AWS is certified under several frameworks, but additional application-specific compliance may be needed.

<br>

### Compliance Frameworks Overview
   - **ISO 27001**: 
     - Developed by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission.
     - Requires third-party audits to verify a systemâ€™s compliance.
     - AWS is certified, but systems built on AWS must be audited separately.
   - **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**:
     - Ensures the confidentiality and security of healthcare information.
     - Essential for applications handling patient data.
   - **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**:
     - Focuses on securing credit and debit card transactions.
     - Key for e-commerce businesses accepting online payments.

### PCI DSS Compliance Requirements (v3.2)
   - **12 Requirements**:
     1. **Firewall**<br>Install firewall configurations to protect cardholder data.
     2. **Password Protection**<br>Avoid default passwords for system security.
     3. **Protect data**<br>Secure stored cardholder data (at rest).
     4. **Encrypt transmission**<br>Encrypt transmission of cardholder data over public networks.
     5. **Update antivirus**<br>Regularly update anti-virus software.
     6. **Develop and maintain**<br>Develop secure applications and systems.
     7. **Restrict access**<br>Restrict access to data on a need-to-know basis.
     8. **Unique identifiers**<br>Assign unique IDs for each user with system access.
     9. **Physical data protection**<br>Limit physical access to cardholder data.
     10. **Track and monitor**<br>Monitor and log access to network resources (CloudTrail and CloudWatch).
     11. **Regular security testing**<br>Regularly test security systems.
     12. **Maintain security policy**<br>Maintain a security policy for personnel.

<br>

### Other Notable Compliance Frameworks
   - **FIPS 140-2**: US standard for cryptographic security, with AWS CloudHSM meeting level 3.
   - **SOC1, SAS70, and FISMA**: Various standards focused on financial, audit, and government data security.

<br>

### FedRAMP on AWS
   - **FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)**:
     - Federal compliance framework for cloud service security, designed to support US government agencies.
     - **AWS GovCloud**: A FedRAMP-certified AWS region tailored for government compliance and data protection.
