## Compliance on AWS
### Compliance on AWS
   - **Compliance on AWS** is a set of controls, standards, and frameworks designed to help customers meet security and compliance requirements.
   - Key components:
     - **Shared Responsibility Model**: AWS manages infrastructure security, while customers are responsible for securing their applications and data.
     - **Compliance Frameworks**: AWS is certified under several frameworks, but additional application-specific compliance may be needed.

<br>

### Compliance Frameworks Overview
   - **ISO 27001**: 
     - Developed by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission.
     - Requires third-party audits to verify a systemâ€™s compliance.
     - AWS is certified, but systems built on AWS must be audited separately.
   - **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**:
     - Ensures the confidentiality and security of healthcare information.
     - Essential for applications handling patient data.
   - **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**:
     - Focuses on securing credit and debit card transactions.
     - Key for e-commerce businesses accepting online payments.

### PCI DSS Compliance Requirements (v3.2)
   - **12 Requirements**:
     1. **Firewall**<br>Install firewall configurations to protect cardholder data.
     2. **Password Protection**<br>Avoid default passwords for system security.
     3. **Protect data**<br>Secure stored cardholder data (at rest).
     4. **Encrypt transmission**<br>Encrypt transmission of cardholder data over public networks.
     5. **Update antivirus**<br>Regularly update anti-virus software.
     6. **Develop and maintain**<br>Develop secure applications and systems.
     7. **Restrict access**<br>Restrict access to data on a need-to-know basis.
     8. **Unique identifiers**<br>Assign unique IDs for each user with system access.
     9. **Physical data protection**<br>Limit physical access to cardholder data.
     10. **Track and monitor**<br>Monitor and log access to network resources (CloudTrail and CloudWatch).
     11. **Regular security testing**<br>Regularly test security systems.
     12. **Maintain security policy**<br>Maintain a security policy for personnel.

<br>

### Other Notable Compliance Frameworks
   - **FIPS 140-2**: US standard for cryptographic security, with AWS CloudHSM meeting level 3.
   - **SOC1, SAS70, and FISMA**: Various standards focused on financial, audit, and government data security.

<br>

### FedRAMP on AWS
   - **FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)**:
     - Federal compliance framework for cloud service security, designed to support US government agencies.
     - **AWS GovCloud**: A FedRAMP-certified AWS region tailored for government compliance and data protection.

## Understanding Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

> ![AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency.pdf)

### What is a DDoS Attack?
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: An attack aimed at making a website or application unavailable to end-users by overwhelming it with traffic.
- Achieved through methods like:
  - **Packet floods**: High volume of packets to overload the system.
  - **Botnets**: Large networks of compromised devices used to flood the target.

<br>

### Amplification/Reflection Attacks
- **Amplification and Reflection**: Attacker sends a spoofed request (appearing as the victim's IP) to a third-party server.
- Common attack methods:
  - **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**: Attackers use spoofed IP addresses to get amplified responses.
  - **SSDP, DNS, Chargen, SNMP**: Other services that can amplify requests.

#### NTP Amplification Attack Example
- **Hacker's IP**: 190.1.2.3
- **Victim's IP**: 245.1.2.3 (used as a spoofed source)
- Hacker sends 64 bytes to the NTP server, which returns 3,456 bytes to the victim, overloading the victim's system.

<br>

### Application Layer (Layer 7) Attacks
- **Layer 7 Attack**: Overloads a web server by sending floods of GET requests, causing a slowdown or denial of service.
- **Slowloris Attack**: Attacker opens multiple connections but never completes requests, filling the server's connection limit and preventing access to legitimate users.

<br>

### Mitigating DDoS Attacks on AWS
#### Five Key Mitigation Steps
1. **Minimize Attack Surface Area**:
   - Use AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to monitor and create rules for web traffic.
2. **Scale to Absorb the Attack**:
   - Use auto-scaling groups and plans to ensure sufficient resources are available.
3. **Safeguard Exposed Resources**:
   - Implement additional AWS security services to protect resources.
4. **Monitor Application Behavior**:
   - Learn normal behavior patterns to identify abnormal (attack) patterns.
5. **Plan for Abnormal Behavior**:
   - Create a response plan based on detected anomalies.

### AWS Services for DDoS Mitigation
- **Amazon Shield**: Provides DDoS protection on Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, and Route 53.
- **Amazon Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Pairs with Shield to monitor and filter unwanted traffic.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Offers visibility into accounts and resources through alerts and metrics.

### AWS Shield Levels
- **AWS Shield Standard**: Protects all AWS customers on ELB, CloudFront, and Route 53 against basic DDoS attacks like SYN/UDP floods, reflection attacks and other layer 3/4 attacks
- **AWS Shield Advanced**: 
  - Enhanced protection for applications on ELB, CloudFront, and Route 53.
  - Provides additional support against larger and more sophisticated attacks.
  - Costs $3,000 per month but includes extended support.
