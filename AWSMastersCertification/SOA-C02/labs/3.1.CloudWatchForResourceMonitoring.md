# Using CloudWatch for Resource Monitoring

### ABOUT THIS LAB
This lab provides practical experience creating and configuring multiple custom AWS CloudWatch dashboards and widgets. The primary focus will be on the following features within CloudWatch: CloudWatch dashboards, dashboard widgets, and CloudWatch metrics. CloudWatch dashboards built with custom widgets allow you to visually monitor resources and proactively take action, if needed. Overall, the dashboards give you a central, visual view of how your monitored resources are behaving at specific points in time.
