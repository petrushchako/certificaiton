# Working with AWS VPC Flow Logs for Network Monitoring

<br>

### ABOUT THIS LAB
Monitoring network traffic is a critical component of security best practices to meet compliance requirements, investigate security incidents, track key metrics, and configure automated notifications. AWS VPC Flow Logs captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. In this hands-on lab, we will set up and use VPC Flow Logs published to Amazon CloudWatch, create custom metrics and alerts based on the CloudWatch logs to understand trends and receive notifications for potential security issues, and use Amazon Athena to query and analyze VPC flow logs stored in S3.
