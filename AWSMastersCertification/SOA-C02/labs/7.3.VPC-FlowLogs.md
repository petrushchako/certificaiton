# Working with AWS VPC Flow Logs for Network Monitoring

<br>

### ABOUT THIS LAB
Monitoring network traffic is a critical component of security best practices to meet compliance requirements, investigate security incidents, track key metrics, and configure automated notifications. AWS VPC Flow Logs captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. In this hands-on lab, we will set up and use VPC Flow Logs published to Amazon CloudWatch, create custom metrics and alerts based on the CloudWatch logs to understand trends and receive notifications for potential security issues, and use Amazon Athena to query and analyze VPC flow logs stored in S3.

<br>

### Generate Network Traffic
1. In a new browser tab, navigate to EC2.
2. In the Resources section of the EC2 dashboard, select Instances (running).<br>You should see a Web Server instance that was pre-provisioned for the lab.
3. Check the checkbox next to the Web Server instance.
4. In the instance's Details tab, copy the Public IPv4 address.
5. Open a terminal session and log in to the EC2 instance using the credentials provided for the lab:
   
    `ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>`

    Now that you have connected to the terminal successfully, the VPC flow logs will record for this connection.
6. Exit the terminal:
    
    `logout`

7. Navigate back to the EC2 Management Console tab.
8. Update the EC2 instance security group:
    - Check the checkbox next to the Web Server instance, and then use the Actions dropdown to select Security > Change security groups.
    - In the Associated security groups section, click Remove to the right of the security group details to remove the SecurityGroupHTTPAndSSH group.
    - Use the search bar in the Associated security groups section to select the SecurityGroupHTTPOnly security group.
    - Click Add security group, and then click Save.
9. Navigate back to your terminal session and reconnect to the EC2 instance using the credentials provided for the lab:
    
    `cloud_user@<PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>`

    This time, your connection should time out because you removed SSH access with the security group change. This will be recorded in VPC Flow Logs as a reject record.
10. Press Ctrl+C to cancel the SSH command.
11. Navigate back to the EC2 Management Console tab.
12. Revert the EC2 instance security group back to SecurityGroupHTTPAndSSH:
    - Ensure the Web Server instance is selected, and then use the Actions dropdown to select Security > Change security groups.
    - In the Associated security groups section, click Remove to the right of the security group details to remove the SecurityGroupHTTPOnly group.
    - Use the search bar in the Associated security groups section to select the SecurityGroupHTTPAndSSH security group.
    - Click Add security group, and then click Save.
13. Navigate back to your terminal session and reconnect to the EC2 instance using the credentials provided for the lab:

    `ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>`

    This time, the connection should be accepted.
