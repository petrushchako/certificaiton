# Creating AWS Tags and Resource Groups

<br>

![](../img/8.1.LabDiagram.png)

### ABOUT THIS LAB
To simplify the management of AWS resources such as EC2 instances, you can assign metadata using tags. Resource groups can then use these tags to automate tasks on large numbers of resources at one time. They serve as a unique identifier for custom automation, to break out cost reporting by department, and much more. In this hands-on lab, you will create a project-level tag and assign it to multiple resources at once, before creating a resource group based on the tag.

<br>

### Objectvies
- Create and Assign Project-Level Tags to Resources
- Create Resource Groups from the Assigned Tags
- Test Resource Groups through AWS CloudWatch
