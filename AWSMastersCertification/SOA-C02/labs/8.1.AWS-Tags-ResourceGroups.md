# Creating AWS Tags and Resource Groups

<br>

![](../img/8.1.LabDiagram.png)

### ABOUT THIS LAB
To simplify the management of AWS resources such as EC2 instances, you can assign metadata using tags. Resource groups can then use these tags to automate tasks on large numbers of resources at one time. They serve as a unique identifier for custom automation, to break out cost reporting by department, and much more. In this hands-on lab, you will create a project-level tag and assign it to multiple resources at once, before creating a resource group based on the tag.

<br>

### Objectvies
- Create and Assign Project-Level Tags to Resources
- Create Resource Groups from the Assigned Tags
- Test Resource Groups through AWS CloudWatch

<br>

## Solution
## Create and Assign Project-Level Tags to Resources
### Review the Pre-configured Resources
1. In a new browser tab, navigate to `EC2` > `Instances (running)`.
2. Select any of the instances listed.
3. In the search bar, enter `S3`, and open it in a new tab. You will see two buckets with starbucket and bigbucket in the names.

### Module 2 Tagging
1. Navigate back to the `Resource Groups Management` browser tab.
2. With the same Region and resource types selected from the previous step, click `Search resources` again.
3. In the Resource search results section, set the following values:
    - In the Filter resources search window, enter `big`, and press Enter.
    - Select all of the instances.

## Create Resource Groups from the Assigned Tags
### Create the `Big-Project-Resource-Group` Resource Group
1. In the left-hand menu, select `Create Resource Group`.
2. For **Group type**, select `Tag based`.
3. In the **Grouping criteria** section, All supported resource types should already be selected.
4. In the Tags field, select the following:
    - **Tag key**: Select `Project`.
    - **Optional tag value**: Select `Big`.
5. Click `Preview group resources`.
6. Ensure the three group resources show up in the Group resources section.
7. In the Group details section, enter a Group name of `Big-Project-Resource-Group`.
8. Click `Create group`.

<br>

### Create the `Star-Project-Resource-Group` Resource Group
1. In the left-hand menu, click `Create Resource Group`.
2. For Group type, select `Tag based`.
3. In the **Grouping criteria** section, All supported resource types should still be selected.
4. In the Tags field, select the following:

### View the Saved Resource Groups
1. In the left-hand menu, click `Saved Resource Groups`.
2. Click `Big-Project-Resource-Group`.
    - Here, you should see all the resources in your `Big-Project-Resource-Group` group.

## Test Resource Groups through AWS CloudWatch
1. In a new browser tab, navigate to `CloudWatch`.
2. Under `Overview`, click on the `Filter by resource group` dropdown menu and select either the `Big-Project-Resource-Group` or the `Star-Project-Resource-Group`.
3. Review the **resource-group-level** statistics.
