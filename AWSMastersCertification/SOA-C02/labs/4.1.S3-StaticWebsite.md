# Create a Static Website Using Amazon S3

### ABOUT THIS LAB
In this AWS hands-on lab, we will create and configure a simple static website. We will go through configuring that static website with a custom error page. This will demonstrate how to create a cost-efficient website hosting for sites that consist of files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts, and images.

## Solution

## Create S3 Bucket

1. In a new browser tab, navigate to the [GitHub repository for the code](https://github.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/Course-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate/tree/master/labs/creating-a-static-website-using-amazon-s3).
2. Select the `error.html` file.
3. Above the code area, click `Raw`.
4. Right-click and select `Save Page As`, and save the file as `error.html`.

> **Note**: If you are using Safari as your web browser, ensure you remove .txt from the end of the filename. Also, ensure the Format is Page Source. When asked whether you want to save the file as plain text, click Don't append.
5. Repeat this for the `index.html` file.
6. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to `S3`.
7. Click **Create bucket**.
8. Set the following values:
    - **Bucket name**: `my-bucket-<>` with the AWS account ID or another series of numbers at the end to make it globally unique
    - **Region**: `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`
9. In the Block Public Access settings for this bucket section, **un-check Block all public access**.
   - Ensure all four permissions restrictions beneath it are also un-checked.
10. Check the box to acknowledge that turning off all public access might result in the bucket and its objects becoming public.
11. Leave the rest of the settings as their defaults.
12. Click **Create bucket**.
13. Click the bucket name.
14. Click Upload.
15. Click `Add files`, and upload the `error.html` and `index.html` files you previously saved from GitHub.
16. Leave the rest of the settings as their defaults.
17. Click **Upload**.
18. Click **Close** in the upper right.

## Enable Static Website Hosting
1. Click the `Properties` tab.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to find the **Static website hosting** section.
3. On the right in the Static website hosting section, click **Edit**.
4. On the Edit static website hosting page, set the following values:
    - **Static website hosting**: Select `Enable`.
    - **Hosting type**: Select `Host a static website`.
    - **Index document**: Enter `index.html`.
    - **Error document**: Enter `error.html`.
5. Click **Save changes**.
6. In the **Static website hosting** section, open the listed endpoint URL in a new browser tab. Once opened, you'll see a `403 Forbidden` error message.

## Apply Bucket Policy
1. Back in `S3`, click the `Permissions` tab.
2. In the **Bucket policy** section, click `Edit`.
3. Above the code entry box, **copy the bucket ARN**.
4. On the right, click `Policy generator`.
5. Select the following values:
    - Select Type of Policy: Select S3 Bucket Policy.
    - Effect: Select `Allow`
    - Principal: Enter `*`
    - Actions: Select `GetObject`
    - Amazon Resource Name (ARN): Paste the name you added earlier followed by `/*` so the policy applies to all objects within the bucket.
6. Click **Add Statement** > **Generate Policy**.
7. Copy the displayed policy, and go back to the bucket policy screen and paste the JSON. You can ignore any errors.
8. Click **Save changes**.
9. Refresh the browser tab with the static website (the endpoint URL you opened earlier). This time, the site should load correctly.
10. Add a `/` at the end of the URL and some random letters (anything that's knowingly an error). This will display your error.html page.
