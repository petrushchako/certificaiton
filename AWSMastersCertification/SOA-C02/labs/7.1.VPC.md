# Creating a Basic VPC and Associated Components in AWS

### About this lab
AWS networking consists of multiple components, and understanding the relationship between the networking components is a key part of understanding the overall functionality and capabilities of AWS. In this hands-on lab, we will create a VPC with an internet gateway, as well as create subnets across multiple Availability Zones.

## Solution
## **Create a VPC**
1. Navigate to **VPC**.
2. Click `Create VPC`.
3. For **Resources to create**, select `VPC only`.
4. Configure the VPC settings:
    - Name tag: In the text field, enter `VPC1`.
    - IPv4 CIDR: In the text field, enter `172.16.0.0/16`.
5. Leave the other settings as the defaults and click `Create VPC`.<br>
The VPC is created but does not have an internet gateway, subnets, or any other functionality.
