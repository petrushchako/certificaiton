# Deploy an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ and Read Replica in AWS

![](../img/5.2.LabDiagram.png)


### ABOUT THIS LAB
In this hands-on lab, we will work with Relational Database Service (RDS). This lab will give you hands-on experience with enabling Multi-AZ and backups, creating a read replica, promoting a read replica, and updating the RDS endpoint in Route 53. Multi-AZ and read replicas serve different purposes with RDS. Multi-AZ is strictly for failover, as the standby instances cannot be read from by an application. Read replicas are used for improved performance and migrations. With read replicas, you can write to the primary database and read from the read replica. Since a read replica can be promoted to be the primary database, it makes for a great tool in disaster recovery and migrations.


### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1. Enable Multi-AZ Deployment
2. Create a Read Replica
3. Promote the Read Replica and Change the CNAME Records Set in Route 53 to the New Endpoint
