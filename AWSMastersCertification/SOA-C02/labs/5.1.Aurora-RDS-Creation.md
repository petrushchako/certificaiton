# Creating an Amazon Aurora EDS Database (MySQL Compatible)

![](../img/5.1.LabDiagram.png)

<br>

### ABOUT THIS LAB
In this hands-on lab, we will create an Aurora MySQL database. First, we will verify that the security groups, network ACL (NACL), and route tables are all configured to allow communication between an instance in a public subnet and an RDS database in a private subnet. After verifying the appropriate settings are in place, we will create the database. Once that is done, we will use an EC2 instance as a bastion host to allow us to connect to our private database from an external source.

<br>

### Learning Objectives 
1. **Validate the Security Groups, Route Tables, and NACLs Are Configured Correctly**<br>Review the provided environment, and ensure your subnet NACLs allow traffic on ports 22 and 3306. Verify that the two private subnets are associated with a route table that only has local routes, and verify that a single public subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to the internet gateway. Confirm the presence of two security groups: one for SSH and the other for MySQL.
2. **Create a Database Subnet Group**<br>Navigate to the Amazon RDS dashboard, and create a subnet group for your Aurora cluster that only contains the private subnets. The subnet group should be named `AuroraLabSubnetGroup`.
3. **Create an Amazon Aurora Cluster**<br>Create an Amazon Aurora cluster (MySQL Edition) of type `db.t3.small` with a reader node in a different AZ using the DB subnet group created earlier and the MySQL security group provided with the lab. In the DB cluster identifier field, enter `AuroraLabCluster`.
4. **Verify That You Can Authenticate to the Aurora Cluster**<br>Connect to the bastion host instance and use the writer endpoint in a connection string to access MySQL. Once connected, execute the`show global variables like 'aurora_server_id';` query. Observe the connection. After that, attempt to connect to the reader instance and run the same query. Observe the results.

## Solution

## Validate That the Security Groups, Route Tables, and NACLs Are Configured Correctly
### Ensure the Route Tables Are Configured
1. Navigate to EC2 using the Services menu or the unified search bar.
2. In the Resources section, select Instances (running).
3. Check the checkbox to the left of the Bastion Host instance.<br>
The instance details should populate at the bottom of the screen.
4. Below Subnet ID in the instance details, select the available subnet link.<br>
The subnet page should open in a new tab.
5. Check the checkbox to the left of the Public Subnet 1 subnet.<br>
The subnet details should populate at the bottom of the screen.
6. In the subnet details, select the Route table tab.
7. Verify that there is both a local route and a route to the internet gateway.
8. Ensure the two private subnets do not have a route to the internet gateway:
    - Toward the top of the page, click X to clear the applied Subnet ID filter.<br>In addition to Public Subnet 1, you should also see Private Subnet 1 and Private Subnet 2.
    - Check the checkbox to the left of Private Subnet 1.
    - In the subnet details, select the Route table tab.
    - Confirm that the subnet only has a local internet route, then uncheck the checkbox to the left of Private Subnet 1.
    - Check the checkbox to the left of Private Subnet 2 and confirm it also only has a local internet route, then uncheck the checkbox to the left of Private Subnet 2.

<br>

### Ensure the NACLs and Security Groups Are Configured
1. Check the checkbox to the left of Public Subnet 1.
2. In the subnet details, select the Network ACL tab.
3. Verify that the inbound and outbound rules allow all TCP traffic and that all other traffic is denied.
4. In the sidebar menu, scroll down to Security and select Security groups.
5. Ensure that inbound rules allow SSH traffic on the SSH security group:
    - Check the checkbox to the left of the SSH security group.
    - In the security group details, select the Inbound rules tab.
    - Confirm that there is a rule allowing SSH traffic on port 22.
    - Uncheck the checkbox to the left of the SSH security group.
6. Ensure that inbound rules allow MySQL traffic on the MySQL security group:
    - Check the checkbox to the left of the MySQL security group.
    - In the security group details, select the Inbound rules tab.
    - Confirm that there is a rule allowing MySQL traffic on port 3306.

## Create a Database Subnet Group
1. Navigate to RDS using the Services menu or the unified search bar.
2. In the Amazon RDS sidebar menu, select Subnet groups.
3. On the right, click Create DB subnet group.
4. Fill in the Subnet group details section:
    - Name: In the text box, enter AuroraLabSubnetGroup.
    - Description: In the text box, re-enter AuroraLabSubnetGroup.
    - VPC: Use the dropdown to select the provided VPC.
5. Fill in the Add subnets section:
    - Availability Zones: Use the dropdown to select us-east-1b and us-east-1c.
    - Subnets: Use the dropdown to select the two subnets associated with us-east-1b and us-east-1c.
6. After the subnet group settings are configured, scroll to the bottom of the page and click Create.<br>The subnet group is created.

## Create an Amazon Aurora Cluster
1. In the Amazon RDS sidebar menu, select Databases.
2. On the right, click Create database.
3. In the Choose a database creation method section, ensure Standard create is selected.
4. In the Engine options section, select Aurora (MySQL Compatible).
5. In the Templates section, select Dev/Test.
6. Configure the Settings section:
    - DB cluster identifier: In the text box, enter AuroraLabCluster.
    - Master username: Leave the default username of admin.
    - Credentials management: Set to Self managed.
    - Master password: In the text box, enter Password1.
    - Confirm master password: In the text box, re-enter Password1.
7. In the Instance configuration section, select Burstable classes (includes t classes). Leave the default size of db.t3.medium.
8. Ensure the Connectivity section is configured correctly:
    - Compute resource: Ensure Don't connect to an EC2 compute resource is selected.
    - DB subnet group: Ensure auroralabsubnetgroup is selected.
    - Public access: Ensure No is selected. The database will not have a public IP and will only be accessible from the bastion host.
    - VPC security group (firewall): Ensure Choose existing is selected.
    - Existing VPC security groups: Below the dropdown, click X to clear the default filter. Then, use the dropdown to select the SecurityGroupMySQL security group.
9. Leave all other default settings, and then scroll to the bottom of the page and click Create database.<br>The database takes some time to finish creating. You should see three resources: one regional cluster and two reader instances. The auroralabcluster-instance-1 instance will become a writer instance.
10. Wait until the regional cluster and writer instance are available (the reader instance does not need to be available). You may need to refresh the Databases page a few times.

## Verify That You Can Authenticate to the Aurora Cluster
1. Select the auroralabcluster regional cluster name.
2. In the Connectivity & security section of the cluster details, review the writer and reader endpoints. The reader endpoint is indicated with an ro in the endpoint name.
3. Connect to the writer endpoint:
    - Open a terminal application, and log in to the bastion host using the credentials provided for the lab:
    `ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>`
    - Verify that the MySQL command line is installed:
    `mysql --version`
    - Navigate to the RDS Management Console tab and copy the writer endpoint name.
   - Navigate back to the terminal and connect to the writer endpoint, replacing `<WRITER-ENDPOINT-NAME>` with your copied endpoint name:
    `mysql -h <WRITER-ENDPOINT-NAME> -u admin -p`
    - When prompted, enter your Password1 password.
    - Show your databases:
    `show databases;`
    - Check the global variables:
    `show global variables like 'aurora_server_id';`
You should now be connected to auroralabcluster-instance-1.
4. Navigate back to the RDS Management Console tab and refresh the Databases page to verify whether the reader instance is available. Even if it's not available yet, you can try to connect to it.
5. Connect to the reader endpoint:
    - Select the auroralabcluster cluster name.
    - In the Endpoints section of the cluster details, copy the reader endpoint name.
    - Navigate back to the terminal and exit MySQL:
    `exit`
    - Connect to the reader endpoint, replacing `<READER-ENDPOINT-NAME>` with your copied endpoint name:
    `mysql -h <READER-ENDPOINT-NAME> -u admin -p`
    - When prompted, enter your Password1 password.
    - Check the global variables:
    `show global variables like 'aurora_server_id';`
    <br>If your reader instance isn't up and running yet, you'll see that you're still connected to your writer instance.
    <br>The reader instance can only serve read requests; whereas, the writer instance can server both read and write requests.
    <br>Since there is no available reader cluster, you will automatically connect to the available writer cluster.
