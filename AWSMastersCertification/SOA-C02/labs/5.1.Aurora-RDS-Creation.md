# Creating an Amazon Aurora EDS Database (MySQL Compatible)

![](../img/5.1.LabDiagram.png)

<br>

### ABOUT THIS LAB
In this hands-on lab, we will create an Aurora MySQL database. First, we will verify that the security groups, network ACL (NACL), and route tables are all configured to allow communication between an instance in a public subnet and an RDS database in a private subnet. After verifying the appropriate settings are in place, we will create the database. Once that is done, we will use an EC2 instance as a bastion host to allow us to connect to our private database from an external source.

### Learning Objectives 
1. Validate the Security Groups, Route Tables, and NACLs Are Configured Correctly
2. Create a Database Subnet Group
3. Create an Amazon Aurora Cluster
4. Verify That You Can Authenticate to the Aurora Cluster
