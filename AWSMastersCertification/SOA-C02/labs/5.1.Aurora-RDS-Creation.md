# Creating an Amazon Aurora EDS Database (MySQL Compatible)

![](../img/5.1.LabDiagram.png)

<br>

### ABOUT THIS LAB
In this hands-on lab, we will create an Aurora MySQL database. First, we will verify that the security groups, network ACL (NACL), and route tables are all configured to allow communication between an instance in a public subnet and an RDS database in a private subnet. After verifying the appropriate settings are in place, we will create the database. Once that is done, we will use an EC2 instance as a bastion host to allow us to connect to our private database from an external source.

### Learning Objectives 
1. **Validate the Security Groups, Route Tables, and NACLs Are Configured Correctly**<br>Review the provided environment, and ensure your subnet NACLs allow traffic on ports 22 and 3306. Verify that the two private subnets are associated with a route table that only has local routes, and verify that a single public subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to the internet gateway. Confirm the presence of two security groups: one for SSH and the other for MySQL.
2. **Create a Database Subnet Group**<br>Navigate to the Amazon RDS dashboard, and create a subnet group for your Aurora cluster that only contains the private subnets. The subnet group should be named `AuroraLabSubnetGroup`.
3. **Create an Amazon Aurora Cluster**<br>Create an Amazon Aurora cluster (MySQL Edition) of type `db.t3.small` with a reader node in a different AZ using the DB subnet group created earlier and the MySQL security group provided with the lab. In the DB cluster identifier field, enter `AuroraLabCluster`.
4. **Verify That You Can Authenticate to the Aurora Cluster**<br>Connect to the bastion host instance and use the writer endpoint in a connection string to access MySQL. Once connected, execute the`show global variables like 'aurora_server_id';` query. Observe the connection. After that, attempt to connect to the reader instance and run the same query. Observe the results.
