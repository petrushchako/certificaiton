# Create VPC Endpoint and S3 Bucket in AWS

<br>

### ABOUT THIS LAB
In this hands-on lab, we will create a VPC endpoint and an S3 bucket to illustrate the benefits available for our cloud implementations. VPC endpoints can be used instead of NAT gateways to provide access to AWS resources. Many customers have legitimate privacy and security concerns about sending and receiving data across the public internet. VPC endpoints for S3 can alleviate these challenges by using the private IP address of an instance to access S3 with no exposure to the public internet.

### Objectives
- **Create an S3 Bucket**
- **Create a VPC Endpoint**
- **Verify VPC Endpoint Access to S3**

<br><br><br>

## Solution
## Create an S3 Bucket
1. From the AWS Management Console, navigate to `EC2`.
2. In the **Resources** section, select `Instances (running)`.
3. Rename the first instance:
    - Select the checkbox next to the first instance.<br>If you selected the **private instance**, you should see in the instance's Details section that the **Public IPv4 address field is blank**.<br>If you selected the **public instance**, you should see in the instance's Details section that the **Public IPv4 address field has an address value**.
    - In the instance's Name column, select the clipboard icon.
    - In the `Edit Name` field, enter public or private depending on which instance type is selected.
    - Click `Save`.
4. Rename the second instance:
    - Deselect the first instance's checkbox, and then select the checkbox next to the second instance.
    - In the instance's Name column, select the clipboard icon.
    - In the **Edit Name** field, enter `public` or `private` depending on which instance type is selected.
    - Click `Save`.
5. Navigate to `S3`.
6. On the right, click `Create bucket`.
7. Fill in the bucket details:
    - **Bucket name**: In the text field, enter `vpcendpointbucket`, followed by a random string of characters to ensure the bucket name is globally unique (e.g., `vpcendpointbucket917321647`).
    - **AWS Region**: Ensure that `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1` is selected.
Leave all other settings as the defaults and click Create bucket.
