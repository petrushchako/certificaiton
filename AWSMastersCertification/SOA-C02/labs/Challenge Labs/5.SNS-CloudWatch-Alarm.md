# Configure an Alert Based on Logging Content

![](../../img/ChallengeLab-5.png)

### ABOUT THIS LAB
In this lab, we'll walk through the process to filter over existing logging data inside of CloudWatch Logs. We'll start by creating a SNS topic without a subscription, then filter our CloudWatch Logs data to create a metric filter. After creating a metric filter and defining our metric, we will configure an alarm to send notifications to our created SNS topic.

<br>

### Objectives
- Create an **SNS Topic** Named ErrorTopic without a Subscription
- Create a **Metric Filter** on the TrackMyErrors CloudWatch Logs Log Group Filtering for StatusCode 500
- Create an **Alarm** Based on the Metric You Created

<br>

## Solution

## Create an SNS Topic Named `ErrorTopic` without a Subscription
1. Navigate to `Simple Notification Service (SNS)` using the Services menu or the unified search bar.
2. Expand the left-hand menu and select `Topics`.
3. On the right, click `Create topic`.
4. Fill in the Details section:
    - **Type**: Select `Standard`.

## Create a StatusCode500 Metric Filter on the TrackMyErrors CloudWatch Logs Log Group
1. Navigate to `CloudWatch` using the Services menu or the unified search bar.
2. In the sidebar menu, expand `Logs` and select `Log groups`.
3. Select the checkbox next to the `TrackMyErrors` log group.
4. On the right, use the `Actions` dropdown to select `Create metric` filter.
5. In the Filter pattern field, select `[host, logName, user, timestamp, request, statusCode=4*,size]`.
6. Test the filter:
    - Use the `Select` log data to test dropdown to select your most recent log data.
    - Click `Test pattern`.
7. You should see no results populate. This is because you're not filtering by **StatusCode 500** yet.
8. In the `Filter pattern` field, replace `4` with `5` to filter by **StatusCode 500**.<br>The filter should now look like this:`[host, logName, user, timestamp, request, statusCode=5*,size]`.
8. Click `Test pattern` again to ensure that the test now returns results.
9. Click `Next`.
10. In the **Filter name** field, enter `StatusCode500`.
11. Fill in the Metric details section:
    - **Metric namespace**: In the text box, enter `StatusCode500`.
    - **Metric name**: In the text box, enter `StatusCode500`.
    - **Metric value**: In the text box, enter `1`.
12. Leave all the other fields blank and click `Next`.
13. On the **Review and create** page, click `Create metric filter`.<br>The metric filter may take a moment to finish creating.

<br>

## Create an Alarm Based on the Metric You Created
### Configure Metric Filters for Your Data
1. After the metric is created, ensure the **Metric filters** tab is selected.
2. In the **Metric** field, open the second instance of **StatusCode500** in a new tab.<br>This opens CloudWatch's All metrics view.
3. In the **Metrics** pane, select `StatusCode500` > `Metrics with no dimensions`.
4. Select the checkbox next to `StatusCode500`.
5. Select the `Graphed metrics` tab.
6. Use the `Statistic` dropdown to select `Sum`.
7. Use the `Period` dropdown to select `1 minute`.<br>The metrics may take a few moments to populate.
8. When the metrics start populating in the graph, use the timeline filter along the top of the page to select 1h.
> Note: You may need to click the Refresh icon on the right to update the graph.

### Configure an Alarm for Your Data
1. In the **Graphed metrics** details, select the bell icon under `Actions` to create an alarm.
2. In the **Conditions** section, set the **than...** value to `4`.<br> This will trigger an alarm if there are more than four events in a 1-minute period.
3. Leave all the other default settings and click `Next`.
4. In the **Send a notification to...** field, select your `ErrorTopic` topic.
5. Leave all the other default settings and click `Next`.

    - **Alarm description**: In the text box, enter An alarm for `StatusCode500` metric.
7. Click `Next`.
8. Review your alarm details and click `Create alarm`.<br>Based on the metric events, your alarm state should automatically be In alarm.
